235,Cuddle Bear Book Drive for Medical City Children's in Dallas by Amber & Jacki,U.S. Dollar,350,6,67%,"Everyone Needs A Hug Sometimes! Jaclyn Drexel and I are asking our friends, family, and anyone
    else that this reaches to help us give medically fragile kids and
    their families a MUCH NEEDED HUG! Our goal is 21 bears in
      FOUR DAYS!!! We are doing a Cuddle Bear Book Drive to help
    kids receiving treatment at Medical City Children’s of
    Dallas to feel comforted during trying and difficult times.
    This is an important mission to both of us. My younger brother was
    born with cancer and he spent the first couple of months of his life
    in the hospital. My son has had a history of going into breathing
    crises when he was younger, often resulting in hospital stays. It
    was during one of J’s first hospital stays that we met Jacki. She
    was one of his amazing nurses. As a prior pediatrics and oncology
    nurse, she has a HUGE heart for kids struggling with their health.
    We decided that giving cuddly bears and sweet books was one way we
    could give back - with your help of course! Why a Cuddle Bear Books Drive? Usborne Books & More has these amazing book and plush sets
    for babies and kids; the book is all about bringing comfort through
    hugs. When given together as a gift, the plush bears and books help
    to bring those hugs to life! Jacki and I will be accepting monetary
    donations to purchase as many Cuddle Bear sets as possible - our
    goal is 21 sets! Here’s the BEST PART , once we
    raise $250 Usborne Books and More matches our donation at 50%! Each
    book and plush combo costs $25. That means, if you sponsor 2 kids by
    donating $50, an additional set will be donated and 3 kids will get
    these sweet and comforting Cuddle Bears! But wait, THERE’S MORE , on top of the Cuddle
    Bear sets that will be hand delivered to Medical City Children’s
    Hospital to brighten the day of the kids receiving treatment,
    Usborne Books & More will ALSO DONATE 5% of
    each Cuddle Bear set purchase to The Scott Carter
    Foundation to go towards pediatric cancer research. Please consider helping us reach our goal of 21 Cuddle
      Bear Sets : monetary donations for 14 sets equals a total
    of $350 (the remaining 7 will be donated by Usborne Books & More
    when we meet this goal)! You have the power to help us make a difference in a child’s life! $25 - Sponsor 1 Child $50 - Sponsor 2 Children (PLUS 1 thanks to Usborne Books & More) $100 - Sponsor 4 Children (PLUS 2 thanks to Usborne Books
    & More) **You do NOT have to donate the full $25 to sponsor an entire
      set, donations of ANY size will help us meet our goal!**",https://fundrazr.com/c1XBq9
7025,Keith Hancock Needs Your Help,U.S. Dollar,210,111,115%,"My name is Chris Lee and I'm a Brit living in Ho Chi Minh (Saigon),
  Vietnam. As an Expat living here, we get to meet many people from all
  walks of life. People of different Nationalities, Faith and
  background. I met Keith over 6 years ago and bonded over our love of
  Pool, and continually disagreed about our football teams (another story). Keith Hancock had had a varied life, including a long career as a
  popular Folk Singer and many of the people who enjoy that scene,
  remember him as the writer and composer of the Folk Standard, Absent Friends. Keith eventually took residence in Ho Chi Minh around the same time
  that I moved to Saigon in 2013 and has used his life experiences to
  colour the lives of the people here in Saigon with his writing and his
  reflection on life, ever since. On the morning of Tuesday 25th June this year, Keith suffered a
    heart attacked and was admitted to the ICU at the Heart Foundation
    in Saigon. where they advised him that he urgently needed an operation. There is no provision for a National Health Service in Vietnam.
    The cost of the surgery plus hospital care and ongoing medication
    will be $8000. We have to raise this money before they will operate.
    Time is imperative. We are asking his family, his friends from
    music, and the many others he has made on his travels for help. We need support in monetary donations and importantly, in people
    actively sharing this appeal to their friends, fellow musicians,
    Folk followers and any wider circle. Any donation will be gratefully accepted. Keith desperately
    needs this procedure to repair the damage to his heart and to
    provide any chance of living out a full and fruitful life. If there is any surplus money after all costs are met, it will
    be donated to the Children's Heart Foundation at the same hospital.
    This provides free heart surgery for Vietnam's poor children and is
    also a very worthy cause. I do hope that you can help.",https://fundrazr.com/91WdFb

    in October and friends for 6 years. Michael has worked since he was
    14. He had a great work ethic and worked not only his full time job
    but numerous side jobs. He was a mechanic and
    painter a nd his main career was for 30+years as a
    Manager and District Manager in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with
    this campaign, I'd also be exlploring hyperbaric treatment; studies
    have shown tremendous results with traumautic brain injury.We are
    optimistic with quality care and less stress that he will be able to
    maintain living safely in our home.",https://fundrazr.com/michaelmaberryshealthfund
17435,Drew’s leukemia fight,U.S. Dollar,20 000,152,87%,"Drew Aufderheide was diagnosed with a rare and incurable form of
  Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per year in the United
  States are diagnosed with this disease and because the cancer is
  caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure it - only
  medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is extremely rare
  for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia.  It is normally
  diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the life expectancy
  is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot of unknown facts
  surrounding Drew's case because physicians and oncologists do not
  often see CML in someone so young and because of Drew's young age, his
  life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val. With this medication comes
  side effects that he must manage.  Drew has met this challenge with
  his usual strength of determination, peace of soul, his faith in God
  and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have
  kept him in bed unable to work, he felt your love and prayers.",https://fundrazr.com/exjqd
2800,Help Bre #keepmoving & maintain their independence with an Alinker walking bike!,Canadian Dollar,28 000,35,100%,"Hey friends! Okay, so... I'm Bre. I'm 28 years old. I'm a lover of the
    creative process and its many forms. I love trying new things
    because I'm always up for a good challenge. However, I'm facing a
    pretty big challenge of a different sort currently and would really
    appreciate your help. I've lived with mobility issues since the age of
    nine, because of multiple spinal issues, but mostly due to multiple
    arachnoid cysts filled with fluid at the base of my spine which are
    compressing my nerves. I've had surgery to drain it in 2001, and it
    was stable for many years but recent MRIs have shown that it's
    become filled with fluid once again. Medically, I'm figuring out
    what my options are at the moment. In October of 2015, I woke up to feeling like there was a
    piece of tape stuck to the bottom of my right foot. Since then I've
    had multiple EMGs and MRIs done and am still left with not a lot of
    answers or solutions. Due to a combination of my complicated case
    and the scar tissue from my previous surgery, multiple neurosurgeons
    have told me they're not comfortable attempting another... so I'm
    left with a situation I need to find my own solution for. To get an idea of what I'm working with here, here's a picture
    of a ""healthy"" spine vs my spine: If you feel like deciphering doctor language, here's my most
    recent MRI report: ( Right-click on the pic > Open image in new tab to see it at full resolution) In summation: YIKES. What does this mean for me currently? Chronic Pain Numbness in my right foot makes it so I can't
      feel the floor when I go to take a step, therefore, balance issues I haven't been able to walk without a cane
      since 2016 I'm not able to walk very far, even with a
      cane, so I've been essentially housebound for these last few
      years, and boy, would I love not to be! I'm reliant on my brother and sister-in-law
      for anything that requires me to leave the house. (They are the
      best and don't mind, but I'd rather not have to!) So... What would the Alinker do for me? I'd be able to leave the house by myself(!!!) I could go get the mail! Grocery stores would once again be within my reach Unlike a wheelchair, I'd be able to rebuild
      and maintain muscle tone in my legs Be able to have a conversation while walking
      again instead of using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall I could enjoy my time at events, festivals,
      family trips, etc. without feeling like I'm slowing everyone down Having a seat with me at all times would be a
      dream come true I could explore the neighborhood and all its
      cool historic sites I could take my nieces to the park I could walk the family dog I would be closer to being as cool as Selma Blair It really would give me so much freedom back,
      open up my world again, and change my life. Thank you for your consideration and support ♥",https://fundrazr.com/f1VtI8

  the local ER. They promptly transported mom and baby to Children's
  Hospital in Milwaukee to be admitted for RSV & bronchiolitis.
  During transport breathing worsened and oxygen tubes were taped on his
  face to assist with his breathing. After no progress, they needed to
  increase his oxygen levels so he was moved to the ICU with an oxygen
  mask put on his chubby cheek face. They were able to remove *some*
  mucus, but it was very little progress. Due to still not seeing progress, Baby Izekiel was sedated and
  intubated and remains in the ICU. Please pray for this sweet boy and his family while he's fighting to
  recover and *hopefully* be healthy enough to get back to the comfort
  of his own home by Christmas with Mom, Dad, big sister and brother and puppies. Any contributions will go straight to the family for the upcoming

    I am asking you for help on her behalf. As some of you may already
    know, Shelby, a two-time liver transplant recipient, has just found
    out that her current liver is in a late stage of chronic rejection.
    She is going to need another liver transplant in the near future and
    she is already in late stage liver cirrhosis. Over the past few years, Shelby has been suffering terribly from
    other health issues as well. Shelby developed Atypical Trigeminal
    Neuralgia which is a chronic pain condition that affects the
    trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from your face to your
    brain. Her Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia (ATN) has progressed to the
    point where she suffers from more frequent bouts of searing pain
    forcing her to significantly cut back on her jewelry designs. Shelby
    has been in and out of pain clinics and hospital for surgeries to
    try and help with the pain for over a year. Her most recent surgery
    for this was in early June 2018 and more will be needed to control
    the facial nerve pain that she refers to as “an ice cream head ache
    that just doesn’t ever go away”. Shelby is a fighter and no one would know by looking at her that
    she was suffering from severe chronic pain or in need of another
    transplant. Knowing the state of her liver, she just won 4 medals at
    the Canadian Transplant Games last month in swimming. She is a strong, motivated, and the most compassionate woman
    you’ll meet who needs our help to show her she is supported in this
    next journey she has to go through. She will never ask for it, so I
    will for her… I am asking you all to help raise $20,000 for Shelby’s
    upcoming medical expenses, prescriptions, bills, hospital parking,
    gas money to VGH, after-transplant care, post-transplant
    accommodations, and more as she prepares for this next medical
    hurdle. Financial worry should not be something she has to stress
    over during this time. She needs to focus on her health and getting
    a new liver. I know Shelby will be more than grateful and so will I. Together
    we can all make this easier for her and ultimately help save her life. (Photo Credits: David Fournier, Scott Gielen, Gerard Gielen,

    boys, Rebecca Nowak was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER+
    and HER2+ an aggressive form of Breast Cancer .  When we
  received the news our worlds were flipped upside down to say the
  least.  I rushed home from work to put my arms around my wife and
  process this new reality, and within an hour received a call from the
  oncologist to come in and begin a plan of action on how we would treat
  the Cancer.  Those of you that know Rebecca know that we truly believe
  in Alternative and Natural ways of Healing, so we were caught in a
  circumstance that we needed more time to process.  We began praying
  and asking God for guidance on this Journey, and to align us with the
  right people/places, and the wisdom to make whatever decision He
  wanted us to make to get Rebecca well.  After much prayer, Receiving
  ""Signs"" and doing tons of research regarding Natural
  Treatments for Cancer we decided to send my wife to an Alternative
  Cancer Center in Tijuana Mexico. (To Read The Full Story of What Led
  us to Mexico Scroll to the bottom section of this page) Since the Diagnosis, and the First trip to Mexico, we discovered that
  the Cancer has Tripled in size, Metastasized to her Lymph nodes and
  possibly her liver.  We are at a point where we need to combat this
  cancer full force but are running out of funds to do so.  Meanwhile,
  The Cancer continues to takes it's toll on Rebecca's body.  This
  morning at 4am I woke up to find my wife sobbing by my side and
  telling me that she's scared and that her whole body hurts, especially
  her liver and back.  The Cancer is growing at a pace greater than the
  treatment that we have been able to give her up to now.  We need to
  get Rebecca to Mexico for an extended stay of 3-4 weeks where she will
  be monitored constantly and given the most aggressive treatments
  possible to counteract what the Cancer is currently doing.  Some of
  the treatments will include Vitamin C, Ozone, Letrile and IUV
  therapies along with a Natural Cancer Killing Tonic, Natural Form of
  ""Chemo"" (Kills the Cancer Cells without Killing the Good
  Cells), and an Estrogen Receptor Blocker because the Cancer is
  Estrogen Fed.   The cost of Rebecca's Treatment, Testing, Scans, for
  3-4 weeks  will cost $53,000. To all of our family and friends that have taken time to read
    this, Thank you.  Please share with your family, church family and
    friends as well.  We will need your help to reach this goal. -Justin Nowak The Full Story on What led us to Mexico In November 2017 Rebecca had a Thermogram done to check for Breast
  Cancer due to a suspicious lump in her breast.  She was given a clean
  bill of health and told by the Thermographer that it was nothing to be
  concerned with and not Cancer.  We were relieved at that point and
  went on with our lives but the lump continued to increase in size. 
  Five Months Later on April 3rd we scheduled a Biopsy which confirmed
  that it was in fact Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER+ and HER2+. 
  The news was devastating and we began to pray for signs and direction
  from God on what to do next.  After weeks of doing it on our own with
  a strict diet change, supplements, and cleansing the lymphatic system,
  with no real improvement, we realized that we needed to get my wife in
  the care of specialists.   Rebecca decided to call the Thermographer
  to let her know that she misdiagnosed us, she apologized and explained
  that most scan and tests are never 100% accurate and they always
  recommend a second opinion if we have concerns.  She also told Rebecca
  that she understood what she was going through because 30 years ago
  she was diagnosed with breast cancer and she beat it naturally at an
  Alternative Treatment Center in Tijuana, Mexico.  Then she proceeded
  to tell Rebecca that she had sent over 500 patients to this clinic in
  the past 15 years and they have all been healed naturally of Cancer. The following morning I was looking through unpacked boxes (We had
  just finished a move to Idaho from California when she was diagnosed)
  trying to find a power cord for the printer to print up some
  documents, with no luck.  On the 20th or so box that I cut open, I
  found a white bag with a bright yellow business card in it.  The color
  of the card caught my attention so I picked it up.  The business card
  was for the same clinic in Mexico and on the back of the card, it read
  Ogden, IA. I was in awe, so I asked my wife where
  she got this card from?  She was blown away to and had forgotten all
  about the card.  She proceeded to tell me that an older gentleman that
  used to come into her work in Iowa gave it to her and said, ""If you, or anyone that you know ever gets cancer, you
    should go to this place, they saved my life and they can save
  yours"" .  Rebecca had this card for 12 years.  It made it
  from Iowa, to 4 different homes in California and now to Idaho to be
  found within hours of hearing about this clinic for the first time
  ever from the Thermographer. Four days later, I was at a swap meet in Garden City, ID.  Within a
  few minutes of being there, I see a guy wearing a Classic Ford Bronco
  Shirt which catches my attention because I sell Classic Ford Bronco
  parts for a living and I own a Classic Ford Bronco, so I say,
  ""Hey man, I like your shirt"" After talking Trucks with him
  for a few minutes, we find out that I have sold him parts in the past
  and he knew who I was. I explained the situation to him about my wife
  and he proceeds to tell me about his mother passed from Breast
  Cancer.  When I told him that we were sending my wife to an
  Alternative Treatment Center in Mexico, his face lit up and he
  proceeds to tell me that his friends wife was battling Cancer for
  years and had been given 3 weeks to live by her
  Dr’s. They wanted to give her one more round of
  Chemo in hopes that it would help, but she refused.  With nothing else
  to lose, she decided to go to a treatment center in Mexico which ended
  up being the same Clinic that my wife and I are going to, and is alive
  and well today",https://fundrazr.com/e1Nbl6

200,Let's Fight Depression with Dance!,U.S. Dollar,10 000,1,2%,"Hi there! My name is Katie and, like millions of others, I struggle
  with depression. As a professional dancer, choreographer, and dance
  instructor for all of my adult life, I've found time and time again
  that when I move my body, I feel a dramatic decline in my depression symptoms. I'm not talking about strenuous exercise (although an intense workout
  can help decrease symptoms as well), I am referring to dance. Or to be
  more specific, Restorative Dance. By performing gooey, calming, yet
  energizing movement, you are allowing your body the chance to begin
  healing. The easy-to-learn steps are a wonderful way to ease your
  symptoms of depression naturally. After concluding a Restorative Dance session, you'll immediately
  notice a rise in energy, mood, and confidence, increased range of
  motion, feeling more connected with your body, and let's not forget, a
  sense of accomplishment for simply taking part! Other benefits of dance include: Boosts Your Mood Reduces Stress Releases Tense Muscles Increases Self-Awareness Improves Balance and Coordination Greater Self-Esteem ...and much more. With your kind donation, I plan to create a Restorative Dance
  DVD—consisting of 3 different sessions as well as a guided
  meditation—and distribute it free of charge to the communities of
  recovery and mental health facilities throughout the country. Whether someone is dealing with depression, bipolar disorder,
  addiction, or anxiety, my aim is to provide a bit of relief to those
  in the process of healing. Thank you so very much in advance. Dance. It. Out!",https://fundrazr.com/fightdepressionwithdance

At first glance you would never know that there is anything wrong with him, but there is. Austin has a red/green & blue/yellow color deficiency which prevents him from seeing all of the amazing colors that everyone else sees! He has always talked about finding a way to allow him to see the beauty in the every day world and I think I have found a solution~ Enchroma Glasses! I have desperatly been trying to save up the money to purchase him a pair, but sadly something always seems to come up preventing me from doing so. You see, he is an incredibly hard working man who is always working to provide for our family. He deserves this so much and it breaks my heart to see him get frustrated when someone asks him to retrieve an item of certain color and he struggles to find it. Recently, we had a gender reveal for our son who is coming into this world sometime during September 2018. We had a balloon filled with blue confetti, and when the balloon popped Austin thought the confetti was pink until I whispered in his ear that he was indeed getting his baby boy. I want nothing more then to be able to purchase him a pair. I have said nothing to him of what I'm trying to do, so this will be a complete surprise! Thank you and have a blessed day!",https://fundrazr.com/81MAW3
1680,PLEASE HELP SAVE MY MOM,Canadian Dollar,20 000,15,8%,"OUR GAME PLAN We are looking into effective alternative treatments to try to
    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer, plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time. The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon. Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally. I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid. This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces. ABOUT MY MOM From an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again. My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy. She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill. She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us. LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUE If you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from
    the bottom of our hearts. Your actions may make a huge difference to
    Mom’s life and to all those who care about her and who don’t want to
    lose her.",https://fundrazr.com/41FO1c

  cancer is no longer in remission and she is now enduring more
  aggressive treatments. Jaymie has been incredibly strong and resilient

  loss from chemo forces her to shave her head. This is a huge show of
  moral support for Jaymie. Even better, we can have a ripple effect of
  financial support by gathering pledges for our individual head shaves
  from our wider communities.  Jaymie will use the funds that we raise
  to pay for her alternative treatments. Please consider participating
  in one way or another to give Jaymie the boost she needs in this
  immensely challenging time. If you would like to shave in solidarity with us, and spread the word

400,$5 can transform my life..will you help me?,U.S. Dollar,5000,14,8%,"My name is Jaisha Kaniz.. I am a loving parent and partner.. I was
  born in the UK but since 2002 I have been living in Thailand and
  working in the surrounding countries. Up untill May 2016 I was all set to save enough money to have SRS
  surgery to complete my journey to become female.... I came out in 2015
  and have luckly had the support from friends and family.. Unfortunately I was not so lucky concerning my employment... I was
  'let go'from my position (unofficially for being transgender) and have
  since been unable to find employment ANYWHERE ... I worked in the
  experimental education industry for 20 years. But it is now apparent
  companies do not want to hire me due to fear of backlash from parents
  having a transgender individual interacting with their children.!! My insurance does not cover this surgery I am barely able to support myself let alone my family Due to the nature of my skill set. My age and my location and the
  fact that I am openly transgender I am in a situation where I Have
  become unemployable! This loss of financial security and stoppage placed upon my
  transition has caused me to fall into a  state of anxiety and
  depression.. And a close suicide attempt..  I must pull myself out of
  this  for the sake of myself and my family..they need their leader back. I'm a firm believer in working for the things you need and I have a
  hard work ethic.. I would even cancel this fundraiser if someone out
  there could offer me a job instead of the $10... I have come to the conclusion that I will never be able to save for
  this surgery  as any money I can make  goes straight to the family as
  their needs come first. I don't like asking for help..and I don't think I can fully explain
  just how important this surgery means to me... That's why I am looking
  for people who can understand or empathize with my situation.. I am
  more than happy to talk with anyone should they wish to know more
  about me. My family. My life.. But it is hard to convey  this in a few
  short words and expect people to understand... I just hope there are enough decent people out there who will help if
  they can... All I ask is for $10....and it will literally change not
  only my life but also that of my family... Thank you for your time Jaisha",https://fundrazr.com/Jaishakaniz
900,Just Need a Hand Up Not a Hand Out,U.S. Dollar,30 000,13,3%,"Hello, my name is Darin John and I am 41 years old. I love my family,
  and the outdoors. I've worked hard all of my life. My first tax paying
  job was when I was 12 years old. I have managed to be gainfully
  employed and take care of my responsibilities since I was 18. Not to
  say I haven't made a few costly choices along the way but for the most
  part I have been frugal. I have never owned my own house or had a lot
  of money but I've managed to stay relatively debt free. I'm proud of
  that and it is really hard for me to ask for help. So its not for me
  as much as it is for my family who depends on me. You see in the last
  6 years I've fallen and broke my back, have gotten carpel tunnel from
  too much work with pliers, and now have been diagnosed with Adult
  Growth Hormone Deficiency. Basically my body is not producing the
  chemical it needs to rebuild itself. Every day I feel more pain,
  exhaustion, and hopelessness. I feel old and worn and beaten like I'm
  aging exponentially. Some days I feel it is more than I can bare and
  it makes me scared for my family. I know I don't have much in me
  anymore and I know my family can't survive on disability or welfare.
  With the rising cost of living I see more and more people using these
  programs becoming homeless. I can't let that happen. The problem is I
  can't save money faster than things come up to drain the savings like
  car repairs, kids expenses, medical bills, and high prescription
  costs, ect. I have a good plan to ensure my family is taken care of
  but I'm going to need help to make it a reality. I want to build an RV
  resort and campground. A lot of people are moving into RV's and Tiny
  Houses in the North West because it is more affordable than renting a
  2 bedroom apartment. Maintaining it would be a job I could manage even
  when I feel wiped out. If I could keep just 10 RV pads rented to long
  term residents, which shouldn't be hard at all, I could supliment my
  current income.  A couple more and I could meet the rising costs of my
  own Healthcare. I'm not a greedy man, I don't want to be rich or
  famous I just need a way to meet my families needs that won't wear me
  out and speed my physical decline.  I've done quite a bit of research
  on it and I'm confident in this plan. I feel like my days of hard
  physical labor are numbered, the clock is ticking and my backs against
  the wall. I need help soon.  If I can get enough people to donate just
  a little I can make a down payment. So I humbly ask, PLEASE. If you
  can spare anything to bless my family and me I will forever be
  grateful. If you can't help financially could you please like and
  share this. Spreading the word will help too and would be greatly
  appreciated. Thank you and bless you all.",https://fundrazr.com/31LI18

3190,Help Nurse/Mama Cel Win Her Battle Against Cancer,U.S. Dollar,2000,58,159%,"Hi! We are friends & colleagues of Maricel
    Aquino , or Lheng (as she is called at home & by her
    close friends), or ""Mama Cel"" to most... a term of
    endearment which she earned while working as a registered nurse in the Philippines & in Norway. ""Nurse/ Mama Cel"", 41 years young, has been diagnosed
    with Stage 4 Lung Cancer. We are knocking on your good hearts to help a HERO in her battle. As a nurse, she took care of
    people, nursed them back to health, and even held their hands at the
    last moments of their life. Now, it is time we give back the love
    & care that our hero has unselfishly given to society. We are raising funds for her treatment and palliative care. Mama Cel has battled the Big C in several rounds for almost 2
    decades, and won. In 2006, she had mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation to WIN vs Breast Cancer Stage 3B . In 2014, she had a big mass on her right chest (fist-size of
    male adult) which was surgically removed and was BENIGN . In 2015, she had a little lump on her left breast, was operated
    and it was BENIGN . Last Oct 2017, Mama Cel was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage 4.
    She took oral chemo meds, and went back to Norway, Dec 2017 &
    continued her oral chemo there. Feb 7, 2018 Mama Cel got her biopsy results: TRIPLE NEGATIVE
    DISEASE. In layman's term: MALIGNANT. :( She started having persistent lumbar pain and last March 2018, 1 Liter of fluid was drained, after she rushed herself to the ER
    in Norway due to difficulty of breathing. She lived there alone (but
    with a few neighbouring good friends who have been her
    ""angels"" as well), & was already having a difficult
    time sleeping & moving around. Hence, the big decision to go back home. Even if the health care
    in Norway is free, it doesn't cover alternative medicine (Mama Cel
    is firm on not having IV chemo; and that was the only option offered
    there, and at an experimental stage at that); and no friends
    can replace the presence of family. This condition has deteriorated her quality of life: Pain Scale
    10/10, weight loss, difficulty in breathing. On May 2018, she was confined for 10 days at the PGH (Philippine
    General Hospital) due to pleural effusion: 3 liters of fluid had to
    be drained via chest tube and pleurodesis done after. June 2018, she was re-admitted at PGH after experiencing severe
  stabbing pain which has now extended to her legs and difficulty of
  breathing. She is now confined to the hospital, conscious and
  coherent, with round- the- clock pain medications and on continuous
  oxygen therapy; Her case was referred by her Oncology doctor  to
  pulmonary and pain management services help alleviate the effect of
  cancer in terms of breathing and non-stop pain. The cost of procedures, hospitalization expenses, palliative
    care and rounds of integrative treatment are exhausting Nurse Mama
    Cel's and family's savings. Your constant & fervent prayers, and your donation will help
    her win her battle against cancer once more. Thank you for caring

  always had issues with certain colors, purple was a big one.  When I
  joined the Coast Guard they diagnosed me with color vision deficiency
  in my medical screening which severely limited my job selection. 
  While I was enlisted I found many scenarios where I simply could not
  perform a task due to being unable to detect a color; i found out
  ships have red and green colored running lights so you could tell
  their heading at a distance at night, I just thought they were white
  lights.  In my new chosen career field im facing new challenges that
  stem from this issue: in our modern age motorcycles are increasingly
  complex, with more and more wires as more things become controlled by
  onboard computers, all color coded and many with slim 'tracer' lines
  in a different color that are very difficult to see in low light or
  even with flashlights.  If a wiring diagram tells me im looking for a
  certain color wire and i cant pick it out of the mess of wires i cant
  do a repair, which is a very costly delay in a job where any wasted
  time comes right out of your pocket. With a pair of Enchroma glasses I could finally be on a more level
  playing field for a job I've dreamed of having for years, and finally

    only option."" Yolanda Atwater – a Rock Island, Illinois native: child of God,
    wife, mother of five, and owner of Sisters Hair Salon - had a Breast
    cancer scare in 2000 and decided to change a few things in her diet.
    She decided to stop drinking coffee, pop/soda completely and lowered
    her chocolate intake. Yolanda started taking natural antibiotics and
    has been in great health, until now. Around the time of Yolanda’s breast cancer scare over half of
    her clients were diagnosed with cancer, she immediately took action.
    After helping multiple clients and families through their cancer
    journey, she founded a program called ""Wigs for Cancer”.
    Yolanda also partnered with her eldest daughter Triona in October
    for her annual ""FitN5 Flex For the Fight Fit Tour"" to
    bring awareness to communities about cancer, alopecia, and childhood
    obesity. March 2018 Yolanda was diagnosed with an aggressive tubular
    breast cancer (stage 3+++), being faith-driven she has decided to
    take an alternative route from chemo, prosperity says the Lord . Yolanda continues to fight naturally throughout her process.
    All of the holistic health remedies have had dynamic effects by
    decreasing the size of the cancer tumor, but a much greater system
    is needed. We have discovered a greater natural system called ""An Oasis of Healing"" a holistic healthcare system. WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW! Insurance will not cover any of these natural expenses. Money is running out due
    to Yolanda's inability to work as well as the cost of her natural
    supply. “An Oasis of Healing” has over an 85% success rate of curing
    cancer. Their four-step system is proven to discontinue the
    reproduction of cancerous cells, while targeting cancer only, not
    damaging the immune system but enhancing the immune system. Raising enough money for admission into 'An Oasis of Healing'
    will allow Yolanda to become a walking testimony, to show others
    that there is an alternative healing process instead of
    chemotherapy. Yolanda will not only learn how to eat and live a
    healthy lifestyle but will ultimately give others a new perspective.

5932,Ride to Give - An Adaptive Bike for Rosalee,U.S. Dollar,58 000,150,102%,"4 and 1/2 years ago, Jessica and Aaron Truelove were
  excitedly awaiting the birth of their first child.  Jessica's
  pregnancy had seemed typical, but Rosalee was born at 28 weeks
  weighing 1lb 15oz. The night she was born, Rosalee had a pulmonary hemorrhage causing
    her fight for life to become even more difficult. For a tiny baby like Rosalee, the chances of her surviving
    prematurity AND the pulmonary hemorrhage were slim. Rosalee ended up spending 73 days in the NICU. At her discharge cranial ultrasound
      on day 69, Jessica and Aaron were told that Rosalee had suffered
      from a brain injury called Periventricular
  Leukomalacia. Her doctors were not sure when this injury
  occurred, but it was sometime between birth and day
  69. Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL) is characterized by the death
  of the white matter of the brain due to  lack of oxygen or blood flow
  to the periventricular area of the brain. Babies with PVL are at risk
  for motor disorders, delayed mental development, coordination
  problems, and vision and hearing impairments. PVL may be accompanied
  by a hemorrhage or bleeding in the periventricular-intraventricular
  area (the area around and inside the ventricles) and can lead to
  cerebral palsy. The disorder is diagnosed by ultrasound of the head,
  as was what the case with Rosalee. Since knowing about her injury early on, Rosalee's doctors were able
  to prescribe interventions which were key to giving Rosalee the best
  possible outcome. As soon as Rosalee was discharged from the NICU, she
  began in-home therapy sessions while she grew stronger and less at
  risk for common germs. During these early months, the hardest part
  with Rosalee's initial diagnosis of PVL was the waiting game. The
  Trueloves became consumed with what Rosalee was or wasn't doing on
  time, basically putting her under a developmental microscope. When Rosalee was around 6-8 months, it became apparent that she
    was becoming increasingly delayed in her fine and gross motor
    skills, but it was not until she was 18 months that the Trueloves
    received the official diagnosis of Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy . Jessica and Aaron continue to work with Rosalee daily to help improve
  her mobility and build her strength. Rosalee receives multiple
  therapies weekly, and as far as her prognosis, her neurologist and
  developmental specialist feel like she will eventually be able to walk
  with assistance for a short distance, but will spend her life
  primarily in a wheelchair. In September, Rosalee will become a big
  sister and the Trueloves are working extra hard this summer to keep
  her on track. One of the things that Rosalee's therapists suggested to help
  strengthen her core and build independence is an adaptive bicycle,
  like the ones sold by www.freedomconcepts.com . Cycling
  would offer her greater independence, a creative way to increase her
  mobility, and most importantly a way to connect with her parents
  through outdoor exercise. The staff at Freedom Concepts have
    visited with Rosalee and found the perfect size bike for
  her use now and to grow with her for years to come. Unfortunately, the
  Trueloves' insurance will not cover the cost so Freedom Concepts
  suggested they reach out to Ride to Give. Ride to Give is excited to offer the Truloves support in
    purchasing an adaptive bicycle for Rosalee.  We have seen time and
    again how alternative therapies, like cycling, can make a
    significant impact on medically complex children like Rosalee.
    Please help us purchase Rosalee a Freedom Concepts Bicycle so she
    can enjoy a life of inclusion rather than one of exclusion. At this time, Rosalee does not have a Facebook Page of her own,
      so follow Ride to Give on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the
      donee organization (Ride to Give, 501c3 tax ID 46-2952297) has
      complete discretion and control over the use of all donated funds.

330,Fundraiser to fight blindness for a young man.,U.S. Dollar,15000,7,2%,"Hello my name is Tony Buss and thank you for reviewing my FundRazr
  account! I am a 26 year young man from Illinois and I am raising money
  to fund future medical procedures I am looking forward to. Three years
  ago I discovered I had vision problems with my left eye which lead me
  to this journey. I noticed this when general shapes and figures did
  not appear how they should in my left eye. After being recommended to
  an eye specialist I discovered I would need surgery to keep from
  losing complete vision and going blind. My diagnosis is a partially
  detached retina. I immediately had the recommended surgeries and
  discovered two years after expected recovery that more surgery and
  treatments will be necessary in order to keep me from losing complete
  vision in the eye. I decided to take action and find a doctor who
  offered stem cell treatments and after long and thorough research,
  found an accepted doctor who could provide non invasive stem cell
  treatments. This would be the best option for me because the typical
  surgery is invasive and leaves scarring which causes further visionary
  issues and health risk. The doctor I found works in a center called
  Visionary Eye Doctors in Maryland. She is a Harvard Graduate who
  specializes in using fat cells to extrapolate stem cells. It is in my
  plan to see this doctor for her procedure and to have the proper
  follow up exams and likely repeat the procedure after it gains
  progress. I cannot wait to return health to my eye and finally be able
  to work a normal labor job again. Many family and friends selflessly
  helped me during this period of my life and returning to work will
  enable me to pay them back. This clinic is also an important research
  clinic for stem cells and I would like to add to the scientific data
  in support of them. My procedure will add to their research and data
  for the advancements of treatments of this kind. Hopefully this kind
  of treatment will become the common practice of health care that all
  people can benefit from. Thank you for reading my story and thank you
  for any contributions, they are very appreciated! If anyone has any
  questions or would like to hear more about my story, feel free to
  message me via email at eden.in.eyes@gmail.com. Thank you so much!",https://fundrazr.com/e1Mjof

  weeks premature, but healthy! Within a few days, Geni was having some
  unusual issues and returned to her doctor. She was resting and doing
  all the things the Dr told her to do, but she kept feeling worse. So
  she decided to get another opinion and see another Dr, who had a few concerns. After 3 1/2 weeks post-baby, tests showed her liver was enlarged and
  excess fluid was in her abdomen requiring a hospital stay to determine
  the cause. More tests, and the determination to send Geni by ambulance
  to Salt Lake City to see specialists and more intense testing. Dr's in
  Salt Lake conferred with a specialist at Stanford U Hospital, and it
  was determined she had all the markers of budd-chiari , a very rare disorder that causes blood clots and
  liver damage. Geni was put on blood thinners hoping to break the clots
  that way, but had to have a procedure through her neck and groin with
  medication shot directly onto the clots to break it up, These
  procedures were hard on Geni, and took hours in the OR. Geni has been
  in the hospital over 2 weeks dealing with recovery. She has been
  unable to work, and will require more time to recover at home. Her
  family and boyfriend have been with her through most of this time
  missing work themselves. She really needs a helping hand literally and

  battling cancer and its recurrence. She survived her thyroid surgery
  and radioactive iodine therapy. Years later, unfortunately, she was
  diagnosed with a rare radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated
  thyroid cancer after failing to respond to radiation therapy and the
  chemo drug Sorafenib. Her cancer has then, metastasized to the brain,
  bones and lungs. It is now a battle against time to prevent further
  progression of her disease. As of this writing, she had been undergoing radiation treatment but
  her doctors prescribed another round of chemotherapy thereafter using
  a drug called Lenvima. Due to the very high cost of this medicine, the
  Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office is providing 70,000 Php worth of
  subsidy per month for 5 months. However, this is not enough as her
  medication for a month would cost 208,620 PhP (3,900 USD / 433,600 JPY). Our mom is currently confined in the Veterans Memorial Medical Center
  for almost a month now and the growing medical bill is already taking
  a toll in our family’s limited financial resources. Hence, we are
  asking all our friends, relatives, and kind-hearted people to help us
  raise funds to cover our mother’s medical expenses so that we can
  bring her home again to spend more time with her. If you or anyone you know could please find it in your heart to help
  our family in any way you can, whether through prayers or through

    full-time all of my adult life, but the cancer forced me into

    Social Services can do for me either. I
      am single, I do not own my home, I do not have any savings at all,

    some kind souls can help me. Note: I had a fundraiser the end of 2017 on the

    to travel expenses (lodging, food, gas, etc.) while I was given

450,Help Michael see color.,U.S. Dollar,450,5,100%,"WHO AM I? My name is Michael Kirk and I'm a
      pencil artist living in Pickens County Alabama.  Many people know
      of my work, but most of them don't know that I draw in black and
      white because I have trouble seeing color.  I have a condition
      known as anomalous trichormacy, which is a fancy way of saying I
      am not totally colorblind, seeing the world in black and white,
      but, rather, I'm color deficient.  My specific condition is known
      as Deuteranomaly or ""weak green"" vision. People like me refer to our type of
      colorblindness as ""color confusion"" because that most
      accurately describes what it is.  Even though I can't see green
      like I should, it affects my other colors as you can see in the
      simulated image below: Seeing the world this way creates some
    frustration from time to time.  Purples can look blue.  Greens can
    look brown.  Even a red stop sign can blend in with the green trees
    behind it and trying to tell which traffic light is illuminated can
    be an outright guess in certain lighting conditions. One of my first artistic experiments was
    with colorizing old black and white photos.  I knew I could be a
    little confused by colors, but at the time I had no idea I had a
    type of color deficiency and bravely colored a few photos, trying to
    be as accurate as I could.  When I showed them off, people told me I
    had chosen a pink that was much too bright for someone's lips or
    that I had chosen a bright green instead of yellow.  I haven't
    recolored any photos since then because I was embarrassed to make so
    many mistakes. I later learned I was truly
    colorblind while browsing t-shirts on the Internet one day.  I found
    a picture of a shirt with a bunch of differently colored green
    circles on it, but I didn't get why it was supposed to be funny. 
    Upon reading the comments, I learned that it was styled after
    an Ishihara test and that normal people could read the caption: 
     ""F*** the Color Blind.""  I was unable to read it.  :( After that harsh revelation, I decided to
    test myself and found some real Ishihara test patterns to confirm my
    fears.  Yes.  I was color blind.  In a way I was disappointed, but
    at the same time relieved to finally have an explanation why I got
    so confused by color.  I wasn't dumb.  It wasn't because I didn't
    pay enough attention.  It wasn't my nearsightedness or glasses.  I
    just couldn't see color like everyone else.  It was vindication.  It
    was closure.  And I accepted it (I had no choice). Back when I first learned I was
      color blind/color deficient, there was not much anyone could do
      about it, but then I saw a video on FaceBook of a color blind man
      seeing the color of his children's eyes for the first time and I
      was fascinated.  His family had given him a pair of, what appeared
      to be sunglasses, as a gift and he could see new colors with
      them.  What he saw moved him to tears.  I wanted to see color like
      that!  Itching to know more, I researched the video and that was
      when I first learned about Enchroma glasses. WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created

    the market and because of my nearsightedness (I have to order a

    type/model) and a prescription fee is $150. If enough people help me get the
    frames I want, I can cover the prescription fee.  I appreciate you

We are keen to raise money to purchase a physio vest to loosen the mucas on his lungs and to reduce recurrent chest infections which will improve his quality life. The vest is £7,000 plus insurance which is a huge amount of money. It would be used as an additional method of physiotherapy but would increase his chances of a healthy long life. Cystic Fibrosis (cf) is a life shortening inherited disease, affecting almost 10,000 people in the UK.  It is caused by a faulty gene. The gene controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your cells, so the lungs and digestive system become clogged with mucas, making it hard to breathe and digest food. Although Aiden looks well most of the time, his insides are not. It is not always visible but that does not mean he is ok! There is no cure for CF  and only half of the population in the UK will live past 41. We want Aiden to be one of them!

15725,Ride to Give - Supporting Pray for Anna,U.S. Dollar,157 000,704,100%,"7-year-old Annaston Cox of Altha, FL was born with a Congenital Heart
  Defect called Mitral Valve Prolapse with Insufficiency as well as
  Graves Disease. At the age of 3, she had her first open heart surgery
  to repair a valve, at Shands Children’s Hospital in Gainesville, FL.
  Just before she was taken back for surgery, Anna was given a shot of
  Ativan for separation anxiety, but within seconds she went limp and
  quit breathing. Anna had gone into anaphylactic shock and needed to be
  intubated. Thankfully Anna’s surgeons were able to stabilize her and
  proceed with repairing the valve. After surgery, Anna started gaining
  weight and truly living life to the fullest. She was just like any
  other child… she played t-ball, cheered for the county league football
  team, and competed with the Kitty Katz cheer competition squad up
  until March 2018 when everything changed. Last Winter, Anna started having severe headaches, high fevers,
  unexplained exhaustion, night sweats, and she refused to eat. She
  began to wake during the night screaming about head pain and became
  unable to walk or climb in or out of bed. Her parents, Ron and Tanya
  Cox, grew increasingly concerned and took Anna to her pediatrician
  several times. Blood was drawn twice a week for a month, along with
  frequent X-rays and CT scans but Anna’s doctors were stumped, saying
  it was either a blood disorder or autoimmune disease. Anna continued
  to suffer. At her wit's end, Tanya demanded answers, refusing to leave the
  pediatrician’s office until she got them. That same day, April 4,
  2018, Anna was admitted to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital where after
  even more testing they still had no definitive answers except that
  Anna might have an autoimmune disease, Meningitis or a bone marrow disorder. On April 7th, 2018, Anna was transferred by ambulance to the Cardiac
  ICU at Shand’s Children’s Hospital in Gainesville. A few hours after
  they arrived, the Cox were told that Anna had Infective Endocarditis;
  strep bacteria had entered her bloodstream and settled on her Mitral
  Valve. Anna was started on aggressive antibiotics, and numerous
  additional tests were run. When Anna’s eyes were checked, the doctor
  noticed that her optic nerves were swollen and her pupils didn’t react
  to light as they should, so an emergency MRI was ordered. While lying in the hospital bed comforting her daughter, a
    team of doctors came in and told Tanya that the MRI had shown
    several small blood clots on both sides of Anna’s brain and that she
    had already had a few “silent” strokes. The pressure from the blood
    clots explained why Anna’s optic nerves were swollen as well as her
    severe head pain. Then Tanya was told the devastating news that they
    had found an aneurysm on the back of her brain and in at that moment
    Tanya realized how truly sick Anna was and was heartbroken. Anna needed her infected valve replaced with a mechanical one, but
  the heart surgeon chose to wait because there was a strong chance of a
  major stroke if her aneurysm burst. Anna’s neurosurgeon was concerned
  because the bacteria was settled on the valve which was still
  producing blot clots. They knew any one of those clots could be fatal.
  The Cox were told without the heart valve replacement Anna would have
  a heart attack, but there was still a strong chance she could suffer a
  deadly stroke. Ronald and Tanya struggled with this decision for two
  weeks until a blot clot moved into Anna's lung and the decision was
  taken out of their hands. On May 1, 2018, Anna had open heart surgery, and her damaged heart
  valve was replaced with a mechanical valve. Thankfully the surgery
  went well, and the doctors were able to remove all the bacteria. In
  the days to follow, Anna was recovering so well that her doctors began
  discussing a discharge date to the step-down unit, but that all
  changed on May 5th, 2018 when Anna woke up around 3 am screaming for
  help. Tanya ran to the bedside and found Anna sitting straight up with
  her eyes fixed to the right and her arms and legs drawn up and rigid.
  Tanya's sweet daughter couldn't see and the head pain was unbearable. Tanya knew in her heart that Anna was having a stroke and just
    as the hospital staff rushed into the room, Anna went limp and quit
    breathing. After being stabilized, Anna had an emergency craniotomy to
  evacuate the hemorrhage that had caused the stroke. Because she had
  just had major heart surgery three days earlier, the neurosurgeon gave
  Anna 2% chance to live through the procedure. The Cox's were told that
  Anna would most likely never awaken following surgery because of the
  extensive damage to her brain. They said she would probably be in a
  coma and on a ventilator and have little to no quality of life. On June 11th, 2018, Anna was transferred to Brooks
    Rehabilitation for in-patient therapy but was discharged on June
    26th because she made little progress during her two weeks stay. So
    with no preparation and still waiting for Anna’s insurance to
    update, the Cox's brought their daughter home. The past two
  months have been emotionally, physically, and financially draining for
  Tanya, Ronald, and their three other children. They have had to travel
  roughly three hours each way from their home in Altha to Anna’s
  specialist, all with two-year-old Branson in toe. Ronald is the
  manager at Roadmart in Marianna, FL and while management has been very
  understanding, his frequent absences from work have had a negative
  impact on the family finances. Anna is almost three months post-surgery and still is unable to say
  any words, follow commands, or communicate. The neurosurgeon told the
  Cox family that sadly Anna’s overall long-term prognosis is poor, but
  Tanya and Ronald refuse to give up on their daughter. There are so
  many things that are needed for Anna that insurance has yet to approve
  or may not cover. The Cox's want to provide the best possible future
  for Anna, but without the necessary equipment, it has been
  challenging. What Anna really needs most is a wheelchair, a
    stander, and a special needs activity seat so she can do therapy at
    home as well as become more mobile. Also, at this time their
    insurance is not covering her tube feeding, so they have to cover
    the $800 a month cost of her supplies out of pocket as well. When Ride to Give read Anna story we knew we had to support
    Tanya and Ronald as they do their best to provide as bright a future
    as that can for their daughter. The funds we raise will
  help fill in the financial gaps while they await insurance decisions
  regarding Anna's equipment needs, her tube feeding supplies, and help
  cover the costs for now twice-weekly trip Gainesville to see Anna’s
  medical team. Please help Ride to Give as we support this sweet family

1262,Help get Kris back on her feet.,U.S. Dollar,2000,16,63%,"On May 15th, 2017 I was in an ATV accident resulting in a surgery to
  place a plate and screws into my leg. On July 1st a severe bone
  infection was discovered and treatment with IV antibiotics began. I
  was then transported from a hospital in Pagosa Springs, CO to San Juan
  Regional Medical Center in Farmington, NM. Since my initial operation
  on May 15th, she has had 9 operations and will have at least 3 more. The first was to clean the wound. The second was a follow-up surgery
  to ensure maximum cleanliness. After a couple of days, the doctor
  noticed a blister that forming on my wound so he preformed another
  operation. This time, to remove the plate and 8 screws that had gotten
  infected. The doctors later found that my bone had started getting
  infected where the hardware was initially placed so they performed
  another surgery to put an antibiotic rod in her bone meant to treat my
  inner bone infection. The last 9 months have been some of the most physically painful days
  I’ve ever had to face to date and I will need additional surgeries to
  get a bone graph and to remove this external fixator that I currently
  have on my right leg. I will have to wear this fixator for 8 more
  months to ensure my leg heals correctly. It has been painful both
  mentally and physically. This would've been my 8th year as a wildland firefighter, which is a
  major source of my primary income. I am and be unemployed until my
  recovery is complete. The monies being raised are to assist my family with gas, food, and
  lodging as they travel three hours each way to and from Dulce, NM to
  Albuquerque, NM for additional appointments as well as surgeries. They
  will also assist myself with bills as I am unable to work during my
  recovery period. I am a member of the Jicarilla Apache Nation and International

  Standing Rock, ND and recently completed a lengthy art project for

  They've softened my grumpy guarded heart, taught me how to love and
  have a little more trust in this world. They will both be spending
  this summer in recovery and I am trying to raise some funds to support
  the cost during this time. Sookie had a surgery on her left knee a few years back and has never
  fully recovered. She continues to experience mobility issues, pain and
  can no longer be by my side day to day. In addition my partner Jake
  will be undergoing surgery this summer and will be in recovery for 2
  months.  The surgery will be happening in the US and all medical
  supplies will be paid for out of pocket. ALL funds raised will directly support: Ongoing vet bills
  (x-ray/tests/treatment), medication and supplements, as well as
  medical supplies for surgery. I don’t feel comfortable asking for help without providing something
  in return so I’ve added lots of “perks” as this website calls them. I
  am an artist so please take this opportunity to get some prints and
  shirts from me. WHY HYENAS? Hyenas are perhaps one of the coolest queerest animals and you should
  celebrate them. ""Hyena energy"" is something I have coined to
  describe a type of connection that I have with others. It is a dark,
  queer, mischievous and rebellious energy. An energy that is seductive,
  chaotic, vicious, a little destructive but ultimately spontaneous,
  indulgent, compelling and dangerous. It is important to acknowledge
  that hyenas are recognized as magical, powerful animals in various
  cultures and traditions around the world. If Jake and I were an animal we would be a hyena. When we met Sookie
  she looked and acted like our little hyena from day one and continues
  to be the perfect addition to our pack. To help raise funds to support both of my little hyenas, I've created
  hyena t-shirts and prints. My dear friend Eli Howey (""Uncle
  Eli"" to Sookie ""My Other Boyfriend"" to Jake) has
  generously donated 31 prints for this fundraiser. Kiana (a.k.a.,
  KRIVVY our “Foster Child” and “Sister” to Sookie) has donated 20

  it reaches the better! I am reaching out to all of you in need of assistance in paying
  medical bills. Not sure how many of you have heard, but I recently underwent
  emergency colon surgery. I went to the local hospital and they had to immediately transfer me
  to a bigger hospital for emergency surgery.  I was informed that if I
  had not came in exactly when I did, that I more than likely would have
  died that night in my sleep. As I'm sure you know, that scared me and I started thanking God that
  I got there when I did. While I am very thankful to be alive and hopefully healed up
  eventually, I now have a few large medical bills I was not expecting
  to have and am not sure how I will afford as I recently retired from
  truck driving after over 20 yrs. So again, I am reaching out to any and all of my friends and friends
  of friends to please help me out. I know everyone is in need of help at one time or another, and for
  people that know me, they know I am the first one to offer help when I
  am able. I am not used to needing to ask for help, so I am out of my territory

  married to Jessica Maury. We went dating for 10 years and then married
  in 2009. I'm a digital marketer and  a wedding photographer and she is
  a dentist with specialty in orthodontics. 2. When we were 1 year into our marriage Jessica was diagnosed with
  MS because she started to get vertigo and went tired pretty quickly.
  Things escalated fast and by the next year the was on a wheelchair. So
  we started looking for treatment, fortunately we eventually found a
  drug that does very well with her, she changed all her alimentation
  habits and with therapy she walked again, with difficulty but can do
  must of the tasks and have mostly a normal life. 3. The money is because the drug she needs to take is about $4000 USD
  monthly (is called Gilenya /Fingolimod) the drug is partly covered by
  our insurance but and plus the therapies and other drugs for symptoms
  things are getting harder for us, also she suffers from a lot of
  spasticity and therapy is not covered by the insurance 4. We are looking for your help to stabilize the bills and keep
  looking for alternative treatments for us to keep going with the best
  life quality we can get, also to make Jessica believe that even if
  things are complicated there's always light and good people to
  confront darkness. 5. We want to ask for your support and to really offer you that
  anytime you come to Mexico city come with us so we can get you to know
  the city I will take incredible photos of you and your family and
  maybe Jessica can check your teeth heath. We know there are lots of
  people out there in need of help and our case may not be the hardest
  one, but we try to also help who ever needs it. so hopefully with your
  help and support we can create a solid chain of favors. Thanks and god bless.",https://fundrazr.com/f1GRT4
1265,Betty's Blessings: The Colors of Alzheimer's,U.S. Dollar,1000,47,126%,"Meet Betty. A vibrant, loving, funny woman
    from Omaha. Cried the entire trip to Southern California sixty years ago. Betty is a mother of four, Grandmother to seven,
    Great-Grandmother to three. Betty is also a sister to two brothers.
    Betty loves her family. To meet Betty is to love Betty. She will
    love you when you don’t deserve it. She will feed you when you are
    full. Betty loves you when nobody else does. Meet Bill , Betty’s brother. Bill was the
    youngest diagnosed case of Alzheimer’s in the US when diagnosed, at
    the age of 48 and succumbed to this disease. Meet Frank ,
    Betty’s other brother, after watching his brother succumb to
    Alzheimer’s, he too fell victim to it. Betty buried her two brothers from this disease. It wasn’t easy.
    The process was financially and emotionally painful. Betty doesn’t
    know she has Alzheimer’s. We don’t tell her. She can’t know. She
    knows its path and it’s destruction. Betty thinks she’s just getting
    forgetful. Betty will never hear that word come out of our mouth.
    She’s seen it enough. She deserves better. To know Betty is to hear her cackle laugh and to eat her amazing
    cookies. Betty hasn’t baked in years. Her cupboards are empty and
    the cookie sheets haven’t seen dough in years. Betty doesn’t
    remember the cookie jar is empty. Oh the cookie jar, the rite of
    passage when entering Betty’s home and the closest route to her
    heart. Betty doesn’t remember how to make cookies. So she colors. 
    With pencils. With abandon. With her heart. A creative outlet never
    known to her prior to Alzheimer’s. It soothes her. It’s the only
    thing that doesn’t frustrate her. It’s not a name or a place. It’s
    not a memory. So she colors. Betty loves her colored pictures and they grace the walls of
    many homes and she is proud of that. Her granddaughters started
    having her sign them and she finds it absolutely hilarious (and
    wonderful) that people want to hang her art in their homes. To
    support the Alzheimer’s Association we are making Betty’s framed
    colorings available for purchase. Each framed coloring is
      $20 (this includes everything, from the frame, to
    shipping). Let a piece of Betty smile upon you daily. We want Betty's Blessings to hang in your home and remind you to
    spend time with your loved ones. When you look at your piece, we
    want it to serve as a reminder to call your own grandmother or
    grandfather, to ask them stories about their childhood, to inquire
    about where they grew up, and to soak in all they have to teach you.
    We want you to call your mom or dad up and ask if all the family
    recipes are recorded, and if they aren't, we want you to start doing
    that. Our memory is a gift that not all are blessed to maintain, so
    while it's there, appreciate it. As our mother, our grandmother, our
    wife, Betty has blessed us for so many years with her love, her
    cooking, her ""happy birthday"" messages and her
    way-to-early-Christmas shopping. If Betty's Blessings can make even
    a small impact on families outside of our own, we know she will be
    happy, even in spite of this terrible disease. Plus, she's been
    begging us to ""get a job"" every day for a while now, and
    this will give her one! To order, please donate through this platform and there will be
    a place for you to enter your address for shipping purposes. If you
    donate more than the requested $20, please specify if you want more
    than one piece. If you have a request, please send the requested picture to orderbettysblessings@gmail.com before donating so
  we can make sure we are able to have her color it for legal purposes.
  No color requests please - we want Betty to use her complete creative
  freedom in her pieces. General theme requests are welcomed as well

  that came to the conclusion that she has been lying to herself for too
  many years. I grew-up in the upper Midwest, surrounded by judgmental
  bigots that force everyone to their way of thinking. If someone was
  gay or transgender, they were chastised and expected to change their
  ways or face certain damnation. As a result of ""coming out,"" I lost everything that I
  thought was important to me, and I mean everything, and have struggled
  since...but I was wrong. I actually gained the clearest view of who I
  truly am, than I have ever have known, but I will survive, and I will
  overcome, that bigotry back ""home,"" which continues to exist
  as well. Here I am and I know who I am...a motivated, intelligent
  trans-woman that is really to take on the world. I see my world
  through feminine eyes, I cry with a feminine heart, and have desires
  that can only come from a sensual, feminine spirit that is putting
  herself into the universe and re-emerging the person she was meant to be. So this is how I need your help. My first $22,500 was stolen from me,
  by someone I should have never trusted. So now, I'm being smarter, and
  using this crowdfunding site to protect your donations and well-wishes. The whole process is going to cost me about $80,000, for what I need
  done. To make things happen quicker, I am going to break it down into
  pieces-FFS, BODY SCULPTING AND BREASTS, AND SRS. I'm scared out of my
  wits sometimes about all of this at times, but I know I will come out
  just fine ""...with a little from my friends."" (Paul McCartney) Why? What really defines a woman vs a man? Feminine attributes include
  sensitivity to aesthetics, appreciation of detail, deeply developed
  empathy and kindness to others, OPEN affections, a certain type of
  strength-pragmatic and compassionate, graceful, and most compelling of
  all, a willingness to show vulnerability. As a male, I didn't see
  myself as being any of these traits. I had to be self-centered,
  selfish, machismo, and not be too concerned about things going on
  behind the scenes. I wrestled the world to the ground and would stomp
  on it...but as a person with whose feminine spirit began to emerge, I
  embraced all of these things and more. Relationships, building a home,
  and being a true partner in life and in the bedroom began to matter
  more than the guys and beer. People are more than just the sum of their parts, and to be honest,
  that is what drives me deeply into loving myself beyond today's
  understanding, and hoping for a new tomorrow. I want to be vulnerable
  to someone that loves me for who I really am...it's more of than just
  sex that drives a woman; it's being alive, in control of herself, and
  using her gifts to build the life she desires, with or without a cock.
  Yes, someone can be a woman with a cock, but I choose to eventually
  donate it to science...I am learning to understand what it is to be a
  woman but haven't yet allowed myself to be totally emersed in it's
  splendor. In some ways, being transgender and being a CIS woman have
  their similarities. You have some of the same prejudices and obstacles
  and when some people find out that you no longer buy into the crap
  they have been shoveling your direction for years, they do everything
  possible to block your path. So why do I want these surgeries? The true person I am needs to
  come-out and live her life. Why should you care if I started out as an
  ego-centered male? It's about where I am now and who I will be, in the
  future. I am totally astonished on how many women feel threatened
  by someone like me because we choose to join them, not control them. I
  have no pretensious agenda other than to share in the intimacy that
  most men will never figure out, and...maybe do a video or two for posterity. I AM TRAPPED IN THE WRONG BODY but it is the realization that I
  have BEEN LIVING THE WRONG LIFE for so long, that makes me move
  forward at this point; I CANNOT GO BACK to the person that was...only
  forward to embrace the future. I have to ask...Which is a greater sin? Lying to the world about who
  and what you are...or not being honest and true to all those that
  matter to you? One's self? Family? Friends? I didn't shun
  them... ""Judge not lest you be judged..."" is found in my
  Bible. They have shunned me. Friends, acquaintances, and those of you
  that I do not know yet, I need your help. I am being a little selfish
  in saying that the life you save may be mine, but it is the truth. Not
  that I am thinking of killing myself because I AM NOT, but the life
  that I am being forced to live is a lie in itself. It's not me. The
  real me is trapped inside this shell and cries every day to get out
  and live. She is sensual and attactive but more than that, she is a
  woman that will leave her mark on the world. Please donate and feel

1217,I lost my insurance and had to return my CPAP.,U.S. Dollar,12 000,19,101%,"I used to be outdoors constantly, working on my hobby farm, repairing
  my antique tractor and riding snowmobiles, sailing, and riding my
  motorcycles.  I've always had sleep issues and had fought against an
  irregular sleep pattern which eventually became too much and my sleep
  pattern started to free-run on a 26 hour circadian rhythm. The
  hypernychthemeral disorder was in addition to a long history of light
  sensitivity and I had struggled with both from puberty on. This winter I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and two
  months ago, I was given a CPAP machine to help me keep breathing
  during sleep. Recently, we lost our insurance which means that I will
  be losing my CPAP machine that was thirty days from being paid for by
  insurance and my risks of both heart attack and stroke will
  essentially triple. I hate asking for help but have no other option as we cannot
  afford health insurance that will cover the CPAP and still allow us
  luxuries like food and heat, let alone internet access. I was forced to return the machine on Tuesday the 18th but I had
  already planned ahead for that. The goal is the same, to replace the
  CPAP I no longer have with one of two choices, they are equivalent
  machines and provide exactly the same support I need and that my
  prescription calls for (these are prescribed devices, I should not be
  able to buy one at Amazon or Ebay at all by law). I will be posting
  links to the two options below. My preference is actually for the
  lower priced one but I had based this campaign on the other one since
  that's specifically what was ordered on my prescription that also
  states that substitutions are allowed. I would appreciate any help at all, my wife, son, and I are
  doing all we can but that doesn't make it feasible, or even possible
  at this point without additional help. Preferred due to other user's referrals https://helpmedicalsupplies.com/products/dreamclean-500-dreamstation-complete-autopap-kit-w-soclean-2?variant=9978908246131 I only have two months of personal experience with this machine

3345,Top Surgery Support Fund for Nate,Canadian Dollar,3000,44,112%,"Hi! My name is Katie and I am creating this fundraiser to support our
  friend and community member, Nate. As some of you may know, our dear friend Nate is having top surgery
  on September 13, 2018. Top surgery is a gender-affirming procedure
  that many trans folks like Nate undergo in order to live life in a
  more comfortable, accessible way.  Nate has been on waiting lists for
  this surgery for over 5 years and he has been binding for 12 years for
  anywhere from 12 - 16 hours per day. This daily binding has taken a
  toll on his body and this surgery will greatly improve Nate's quality
  of life and the ease with which he moves through the world. As a
  community, we have an opportunity to come together to support Nate
  during this exciting and challenging time by helping him to pay for
  surgery and supporting him during his recovery time. HOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED? 1) While OHIP covers much of the cost of this surgery, there is a
  cost of $2,360 that is not covered by OHIP. We hope to raise at least
  this much money so that Nate can focus on recovery and does not have
  the burden of this surgery cost weighing on him. 2) It would be absolutely wonderful if we could raise some money to
  support Nate's costs of living and healing process while he is off
  work after his surgery. As most of Nate's friends and community know,
  he works as a baker (and is darn amazing at it!). While baking is one
  of Nate's great passions, it is also a very physically demanding job
  and will require Nate to be off of work for 8 - 12 weeks-- much longer
  than if he had a less physical job. Any money raised over and above
  the initial goal of $2,360 will go directly to supporting Nate's
  recovery. No amount is too little to donate, even if it is only a few dollars! WHAT IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO DONATE? It's totally okay if you aren't able to donate right now! Here are
  some other ways you can help Nate: 1) SHARE THIS FUNDRAISER! Let's get the word out there by sharing
  this fundraiser on social media - give your friends and community the
  opportunity to help out by sharing this campaign. 2) Consider creative ways that you could contribute. For example,
  maybe you don't have the cash, but maybe you work somewhere that would
  be cool with you putting out a donation jar! 3) Offer tangible support. You can reach out to Nate's partner Tanya
  at smithsalter -at- gmail -dot- com to arrange tangible support. For
  example: running errands, dropping off food, dog walking, garden help,
  etc. while Nate recovers. 3) Support The Feral Knot on Etsy and beyond! Nate's partner, Tanya, has a
  (super amazing) small business creating macrame art, rustic woodwork,
  healing plants, and facilitating macrame workshops. You can support
  The Feral Knot by liking the page on Facebook / Instagram , sharing, and as the holidays approach,
  consider supporting Nate and Tanya by supporting The Feral Knot. 4) Reach out to Nate for social get-togethers beginning 1- 2 weeks
  after surgery! Nate will be recovering for 8 - 12 weeks, and after the
  initial post-surgery period, he will appreciate friends reaching out
  for low-key coffee, picnics, and hang outs. Anyone who knows and has shared space with Nate knows that he is an
  incredible, generous, and caring human being. Nate deserves all of the
  support in the world, and I am confident that we can help to ease some
  of the financial burden that comes with surgery and post-surgery healing. WANT TO LEARN MORE? Feeling confused about top surgery, recovery times, and all of this

  to help a test patient condition to be better. By combining the setup of Aquaponics system and Deli Kitchen can help
  to provide mentally ill patients in such:- Providing income Helping them learning new skills Meeting up with different people Eating healthy Helping them utilizing their time properly Helping them to understand the better meaning of survival Reducing their mental stress We have been understand, researching and planning for nearly 8- 10
  years for this project, we feel that most of the time, humans need
  each other to cope with day to day life, and building a meaning in life. In this fast moving era, people struggling to cope with stress, and
  quite a number of them develop stress symptoms such as mental illness,
  which there is no medicine can help to cure, and most of the medicines
  provided by all clinics and hospitals do have serious side-effects,
  for example weigh gain and others unhealthy conditions for these
  mentally ill patients. Also society having a hard time to assist these mentally ill
  patients, therefore there is a need for us to have this project to
  help them. By understand what caused mental illness, we have develop this
  project to its maximum potential and sustainability. Every quarterly and yearly, the society organized a lot of fund
  raising to help these people, much money have been raised, but never
  enough to support the needs and care for these mentally and disability
  people. Therefore, we feel there is a need to have this project, and
  soon we will have this project all over the world to support these people. Therefore, we created “AQUADELI”. AquaDeli is create based on having a true 100% sustainable Aquaponic
  System, which capable of powering by itself and Deli Kitchen to
  showcase affordable good healthy food from our Aquaponic harvest. The KEY: Our Aquaponics System is capable to power the entire setup
    together with the deli kitchen electrical requirements. Does not need Solar Panels, Does not need Wind Turbine, Does not need Diesel Generators, Basically, we harness the energy from the moving water, and the
  chemical properties of water to create energy, as we know that
  electricity cost is very expensive. So we have develop a system with
  the help of our engineers to make full use of the environment “NATURE”
  around us to give us FREE Energy. Aquaponics is using Fishes, Prawns and Seeds: It is a simple Food chain process which make this whole
        project run. Meaning, plants from seeds needs nutrients and
        water to grow, by making use of “Fish poo (Manure)”, plants are
        able to grow better, naturally and chemical-free conditions. Why Prawns? Prawns are needed in this system, they act as the
        filter and composter for the Fish Poo, breaking down poo so that
        plant roots are able to pick and absorb nutrients from the water. And best of all, we do not need expensive or any man made
        filter to clean the water, as the water pass through the roots
        of the plants, it is cleaned and send back to the fishes. In
        this way, we do not have to change water for the fish or the
        whole system forever. Deli Kitchen Charles and Samantha have been self-trained chefs by Gordon
        Ramsay, Raymond Blanc and some other World Renowned Chef to
        create food from the garden. We have been cooking these food for more than 8 years, sampled
        by many people around us, and responds are very good. Making use of this Deli Kitchen, we are able to :- Develop new healthy food, Increase profits for the project, Creating the awareness of different types of healthy food, Awareness & existence of such a project to the world. Deli Kitchen is powered by the Aquaponics System. Especially Ovens, Cooktops, Fridges, etc. Lightings, Ventilations, etc. There are many Aquaponic System in the world, but what makes us
  unique is because it is fully sustainable and it is the first of its
  kind in the world, and it is the perfect project to serve our mission
  to help mentally, disabilities, and sustainable healthy chemical free food.",https://fundrazr.com/aquadeliformentally

8730,Please help Meredith get the spinal surgery she needs!,U.S. Dollar,8000,74,109%,"Hey friends and family. In March of this year while visiting Daniel’s
  parents in Panama we took a horseback ride (my first ever) on the
  beach where I rode a horse galloping across the sand for some time.
  (The photo above was taken on that trip before the horseback ride.)
  The next morning I had severe pain and difficulty walking. I saw a
  doctor there who suggested I continue with some chiropractic treatment
  when I got back to the states. Back in the US I continued to see
  several chiropractors, an acupuncturist, and a physical therapist.
  Some thought it was my piriformis muscle or my sacrum. But no matter
  the amount of rest or stretching the pain only got worse.  Eventually
  over the summer I received an MRI and consulted with an spine
    surgeon after finding out the issue was actually with my spine. I
    have a 4-5mm herniated disc on my L5 S1 that is pressing directly
    onto the nerve root in my left leg causing extreme pain and
    inflammation. Through this whole ordeal I have not had health insurance. Ive had to
  continue to work my personal assisting job which is fairly physical
  (cleaning, shopping, laundry, errands etc) to be able to pay cash for
  each treatment I received. I also started to drive for postmates and
  babysit to earn extra cash to pay for treatment. When that wasn’t
  enough Daniel, my family (hey mom hey dad) and even my boss have
  contributed financially to helping me heal my back. In August a dear
  friend (Holly) put me in touch with a reputable spine surgeon in
  Glendale, CA. He suggested I exhaust all options before considering
  surgery. So that is what I did. I continued aggressively with
  acupuncture, spinal decompression therapy, massage, hot and cold
  compresses, lots of rest, supplements, anti inflammatory diet, PT,
  oral steroids, CBD, you name it. I even tried meditation, reiki,
  hypnosis, and psychic surgery!!! The final and last option was an
  epidural steroid shot which I have had 2 of in the past two weeks and
  have not received any relief. At this point I need a minimally invasive surgery called a posterior
  lumbar microdiscectomy. Its a same day surgery but involves general
  anesthesia and about a 4 week recovery time. The surgery would remove
  the part of the disc that is compressing my nerve and spinal canal.
  Through prayer, some angelic energy in the universe and the kind
  referral of my friend Holly,  this surgeon has offered to completely
  waive his fee and perform my microdiscectomy costing me only the fees
  for the anesthesiologist and the medical facility! This will be about
  6-7,000 dollars. (I will also need some blood work and some X-rays
  done before the surgery is performed) This type of surgery isn’t covered under medi-cal or hmo insurance. 
  (Im not eligable for medi-cal and open enrollment for other insurance
  doesn’t begin coverage until Jan 2019)  Since about August I haven’t
  been able to drive for postmates to earn extra money because of the
  pain caused by sitting. The 8+ months of treatment have left me with
  no savings or financial padding at this point. I will also still need
  to pay my rent and feed myself during my 4 weeks of post op recovery. My closest friends have witnessed this journey but to others I have
  been fairly quiet about it all. As a performer it’s not a good look to
  hire someone who is suffering from a spinal injury. Also I kept having
  hope that one of the treatments one day would make an impact. My
  management even told me they would not submit me for anything until I
  was medically cleared by a doctor. (They have since dropped me during
  this process) To give you a peak into my world, normal daily
  activities are a major challenge for me. I have trouble putting my own
  pants and shoes on, shaving my legs, bending, sitting more than a few
  seconds or standing after sitting for a few minutes. I drive with a
  special decompression pillow in my car and I only wear special
  orthopedic sneakers. I can’t go do yoga or indoor cycling since March
  (something i used to do 3-4 times a week) or travel more than a few
  miles from home since sitting causes the most pain. I have to lay down
  several times during the day interrupting normal daily activities.
  This has been a real major life event and has given me much
  perspective on what’s most important in life. Our health and our loved
  ones.  I’m so appreciative to anyone who has reached out during this
  process or sent me a text. I’m especially grateful to Dr. Dave Rogers
  and Holly Hyman my real life fairy godsister. Anything you can
  contribute means the world and I thank you from the bottom of my
  heart. I know what it’s like to need every penny in your bank account,
  and I’m humbled by any contribution. Break down of finances : 1,000 for anesthesiologist fee 5,000 for medical facility fee 500 for X-rays, and blood work needed before operation 1,500 to cover my rent, food, and car insurance the month I will be
  recovering and won't be able to work.",https://fundrazr.com/71Pe66

    to long it can cause cardiac arrest or a stroke. I have been on meds
    for quite a while to control it but in the last year those meds have
    not been working as well. Back in March I was hospitalized and they
    performed an ablation to fix the problem. Unfortunately that did not
    work. I have lost employment because of not being able to be there

3630,Help John fight cancer and graduate from Fanshawe,Canadian Dollar,30 000,42,12%,"Myself : My name is John Olliffe, and this is my story of diagnosis and the
  challenges I am facing with my current prognosis, and life situation. I am a 49 year old mature student enrolled in the Computer System
  Technology program at Fanshawe College, in London Ontario.  I'm a
  proud dad to two wonderful daughters and a couple of Shar Pei's, and
  this September my wife and I are celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. After almost 25 years of doing social service work, I decided I
  needed a change, and left to return to school to study Information
  Technology at Fanshawe College.  I an currently in my final year of
  studies and hope to graduate this spring with my cohort. However, that's in jeopardy, along with a few other things, thanks to
  my medical problems. Medical Issues: Shortly before Chistmas 2017,
    while on a co-op placement for my program, I began to experience a
    recurring pain in my leg.  It would get better for a few days then
    come roaring back. The first time I sought medical
    help for it I stopped in emerg In St, Mary's on my way home from
    school.  The Dr examined me and concluded I had like torn a muscle
    in my leg, but because of my weight wanted to rule out deep vein
    thrombosis, and so scheduled me for a ultrasound. The results were, of course
    negative, so I treated it as a torn muscle, with RICE etc, and
    carried on.  Until it became unbearable and my wife had to drive me
    into the the emergency room in Stratford. This Dr thought it may be some
    kind of nerve pain in my thigh, but because of my weight wanted to
    rule out bursitis so he ordered an x-ray.  When I got to the x-ray
    department I was surprised to learn that they were x-raying my hip
    instead of the thigh bone, above the knee, where it actually hurt. 
    I explained my annoyance to the tech but she told me should could
    only do what the Dr ordered. Well that x-ray came back negative
    and I was sent on my way with a Rx for nerve pain and a plan to
    follow up with my family Dr ASAP since I was frustrated that both
    medical professionals had ignored my actual complaints about WHERE
    the pain was located and instead focused on my weight. Well, the semester was condensed
    due to the faculty strike,  and by this time it was late in the
    semester.  So I had to wait until after exams when I was in my next placement. My family Dr was great he listened
    about where it ACTUALLY hurt, checked range of motion etc before
    jumping to conclusions.  After all his checks he too figured it was
    something soft tissue related, and made a referral for me to a 
    sports therapy clinic.  However, he wanted an x-ray of the actual
    area of paint to go along with me so that they could rule out
    skeletal issues and then get on with a regime of physio. It didn't turn out that way. Instead, I got a call from my Dr's
    office saying they needed to see me and I had to get blood work done
    first.  When I went in my blood work was inconclusive, and he told
    me they'd found something on the x-ray and wanted to schedule more tests. So after an MRI, and more blood
    work it was concluded that it was likely metatstatic prostate
    cancer.  So more tests, this time a full body bone scan, a full
    thorax and head CT scan and a prostate biopsy.  And it was official
    I had advanced stage 4 prostate cancer with several metastatic
    sites, and I was devastated. The Challenge: As a full time student, a father,
    and husband of a wife who is only working part time, money is
    tight.  Well I'll be honest, beyond tight.  Cancer treatment is
    neither cheap or easy on the body and as a result I have not been
    able to work full time hours at my placement. Between out of pocket expenses, medical costs, and missing work due
  to appointments, medical tests, and treatment side effects we are in
  dire financial straights and have had one bill go to third party
  collections already. The average annual cost to fight cancer in Canada is over $60,000. 
  Well more than we are making, even including OSAP and health benefits
  from the college. What my family and I are looking for is help with the day to day

455,Battle Batten with us,Pound Sterling,100 000,18,0%,"Amazing parents Andrew and Sarah are raising funds to help their
  beautiful twin boys Freddie and Louie, and other children suffering
  from the rare, degenerative condition, CLN5 Batten disease. Freddie and Louie Dawkins are the only known twins in the world with
  this rare form of a rare disease. Born perfectly healthy in 2005, they
  became autistic, blind and recently developed epilepsy. When they were
  diagnosed in 2009, doctors said that without major advancements in
  medical science, there was no hope, no treatment and no cure. In February 2014 Andrew and Sarah decided to fight back through
  ‘Battle Batten’ their very own campaign to exclusively raise money for
  research into CLN5 Batten disease. Originally aiming for just £1,000, they have so far raised an
  incredible £80,000 and unbelievably commissioned two research
  projects. They are the first UK family to privately commission
  research into CLN5 Batten disease; donating funds to the Batten
  Disease Family Association (BDFA), a charity who is managing the
  projects on the family’s behalf. The cash raised in just 12 months has been unexpected, and
  emotionally overwhelming for the family and still, the momentum and
  passion is strong. The family will continue to fundraise for as long
  as they can. Proceeds will be donated to research projects and will
  buy equipment that best offers hope to children with CLN5, including
  Freddie and Louie.",https://fundrazr.com/611LCf

20915,Help Geoffrey Walk Again,U.S. Dollar,22000,65,95%,"Hi, My name is Sarah and I'm trying to raise money to help my big
  brother, Geoffrey. My entire life, Geoffrey has been an amazing athlete; he's someone
  who could out run, out climb and out catch anyone. My first memory is
  sitting on the bleachers when I was three watching his baseball games;
  to be honest I mostly liked going for the hot dogs, but I still
  remember watching him run around the bases in a flash of white, blue
  and dust. As I grew up, Geoffrey was someone I always looked up to -- he was
  the amazing skateboarding ninja, a rock climber, adventurer, surfer,
  accomplished chef and snowboarder. When I was 13, he was living and
  snowboarding full time in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of my happiest
  memories was watching him win a snowboarding competition - long before
  snowboarding was an Olympic sport. He was a natural on the snow, able
  to move across, around and over it like a bird gliding over the currents. Now, Geoffrey has trouble walking. He's developed avascular necrosis
  - or bone death - in both of his ankles. I didn't know what that meant
  either when he first told me. What it does mean is that he's in
  constant pain  and has trouble walking.  I do know that it's very rare
  to develop this in the ankles, especially in people as young as he is,
  and that it's very difficult to fix. After seeing many doctors and specialists over the past two years,
  he's finally going to be able to have surgery at the  San Francisco
  Orthopedic Surgery Center in July. They've told him he'll have to have
   arthroscopic surgery on each ankle -- which means going into the
  joint and scraping away the damage and fixing the bone, ligament and
  cartilage as they go along. In some ways Geoffrey is lucky; if the
  surgery goes well, then he'll be able to walk again without having to
  have his ankle joints replaced. To make this happen my mom, Elizabeth Worley, and Geoffrey have been
  looking for a way to make sure Geoffery can get the surgery and
  support he needs to walk again. His insurance will cover most of the
  surgery cost itself, but he'll need to have intensive rehab and
  physical therapy to help him heal and be able to walk again -- and it
  could take between six and eight months for both ankles to heal.  And
  this is where we need your help. For an additional $25,000, we can cover everything his insurance
  won't and make sure he has the support he needs to heal. This mean
  Geoffrey will be able to walk again, be able to work again, and, while
  his snowboarding days are behind him, with your help he'll be able to
  keep up with his amazing dog, Max.",https://fundrazr.com/11Md51

  have him as one of my best mates. He's always up beat and the life of
  the party but this week has really rocked him. There were no real warning signs except
  tummy pains a few weeks ago. His doctor first diagnosed anemia with a
  blood count of only 80 ( should be 140-160) Further testing with a colonoscopy found
  the malignant tumour in his bowel. This news couldn't have come at a worse
  time. He lost his job at the council 2 days before. With zero sick pay
  and holiday pay, every cost will be his responsibility and being on
  his own makes it even harder. He's too lethargic, dizzy and out of
  breath to work. His doctors have made it clear he needs to rest until
  they can operate. We will not know the full costs involved at
  this point or the ongoing expenses involved while Batchy remains out
  of work and in recovery. It depends on how the surgery goes and what
  other treatments may follow... but of course will keep you in the loop. There are MANY beautiful friends of Batchys
  out there who are asking what they can do to help!? ❤️Well this is it... No matter how big or small, every little

2185,Help Catherine get moving again!,U.S. Dollar,21 000,27,104%,"Hi! My name is Catherine and I am a retired ballet dancer and
  teacher. As you might guess, I am very fond of moving! A couple of
  years ago, however, I was diagnosed with arthritis of the hip and this
  past year I have been using a cane to help me get around. I have a
  physical therapist who also helps me retain the flexibility, mobility
  and strength I still have. He told me that the most important thing is
  just to KEEP MOVING. Therein lies the problem, though, because the hip
  is a weight bearing joint and walking is painful. As my mobility has
  decreased, my weight has increased which puts even more strain on the
  hip. It's a vicious cycle. I know what you're thinking, ""Why not
  just get a hip replacement?"" Believe me, many friends have asked
  the same question but unfortunately, because of other health issues,
  surgery is not a viable option for me. Then I found a mobility device called the Alinker (see video), a three-wheeled walking bike designed to help people remain
    active, do what they love, and build strength so they can live life
    to the fullest. It's an alternative to the typical
    ""walker"" or a motorized scooter. My goal is to
  remain active as a volunteer in my church and my community. I work in
  a food pantry, volunteer often at my church as well as sing in my
  church choir, and I also participate in a community chorus that
  performs regularly at community events and nursing homes. The Alinker is not covered by insurance. As you know, insurance
  companies do not have a vested interest in keeping us healthy. But
  staying healthy is MY goal and I'm asking for your help by way of a
  donation to my campaign. Anything you can do will be helpful and I
  thank you in advance for your support.",https://fundrazr.com/01Q2F8

18770,HELP TO HEAL OUR SWEET ROSALINA!,U.S. Dollar,200,23,3%,"OUR SWEET AND MOST PRECIOUS FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER
  ROSALINA was diagnosed last month with aggressive, high risk,
  stage IV neuroblastoma, the second most common pediatric cancer after leukemia. Testing was done and has showed that there is a massive primary
  tumour in her abdomen, which is pushing up on her pancreas, liver and
  some blood vessels, and which has spread to some of her lymph nodes,
  causing two other tumours. One is in the nodes behind her heart
  between the lungs, which we are told is inoperable, and one in her
  left clavicle. There are also ""innumerable"" smaller sites
  detected in her abdominal area. The cancerous cells have also been
  found in her bone marrow and in the bones in her thighs, upper arms
  and mid-spinal regions. We are completely devastated and life has ceased to be the
  same as it was before her diagnosis. Everything except Rosalina and
  her baby sibling, to be born any day now, has ceased to be of priority. We have been practically living at the Children's Hospital of Eastern
  Ontario since the diagnosis, and Rosalina has already received two
  cycles of chemotherapy. Her conventional treatment plan is to last a
  year and a half, and is just as aggressive as her cancer. We hope to
  counteract some of its very scary side effects with complementary
  therapies and boost her immune system as much as we can so that she
  has all that she needs to get well and stay well. WE CAN'T LET GO OF THE HOPE AND EFFORTS TO HEAL OUR SWEET ROSALINA! We will apply any feasible treatments and complementary therapies
  that we can- this is why we are raising funds for her. These
  treatments include buying Rosalina all organic foods all of the time,
  purchasing supplements of vitamins and minerals and paying for
  naturopathic therapies such as acupuncture sessions. We are also
  raising funds to help pay for travel costs. Our family sincerely thanks you for your contributions. They will all
  add up to making life easier to manage and help to HEAL OUR

      enhance the lives and reduce the suffering of the most vulnerable
      - persons with disabilities . Our two previous crowdfunding campaigns exceeded our goals

      off-line. The first helped get us started by funding travel,
      accommodation, security and expenses for our photographer, Scott

      to produce and distribute content from that trip - stories, video
      interivews, photographic essays, articles, and for developing
      social media and web channels to grow awareness and encourage
      engagement. We also are so fortunate to have many professional

68410,URGENTLY NEEDED New Hips for Christian McCudden!!,Australian Dollar,81000,32,84%,"Hi, my wife and I have been friends with Christian and Melissa for nearly
    twenty years... it has been many years since we have caught up with
    this wonderful family and after a recent phone conversation with
    Christian we have only just now learned of the ongoing physical
    hardship he has been going through over the years and the very
    difficult decision he has just had to make..... After our chat I thought there has to be something we can do to
    help, so I have setup this campaign in the hope that you will all
    join us in standing together to make a massive difference to
    Christian’s upcoming journey! Following is a snapshot of the McCudden family and Christian’s
    journey so far and the reasons why our donations are so very vital
    and impactful at this time for them... Christian has been married to Melissa for 21 yrs. and they have
    3 three amazing children, Noah, Ella and Zachary. In 2013 Christian & Melissa moved from their home in
    Sydney's northern beaches leaving family, friends and working at C3
    Oxford falls as one of the full time pastors, and planted C3 church
    Noosa, launching in May of 2013. Prior to planting C3 Noosa they were a part of C3 Oxford falls
    for 20 years. Over that time Christian fulfilled many roles in various
  areas including: Youth ministry for 12yrs / Pastoring / Lecturing in the Bible College. Travelled with and assisted Ps Phil for 6 years. Project managed the buildings and renovations that went on over the
  years at C3 Oxford falls. Christian has also over many years ministered in Church's throughout
  Australia, New Zealand, America, Europe, Asia and Indonesia seeing
  many people saved, healed and touched by the power of God. He has also seen over the year’s incredible healings and testimonies. Blind eyes opened / Deaf ears opened / Cancer healed Crippled people getting out of wheel chairs / Stroke patients healed
  and walking and speaking. Pain leaving bodies immediately / Blood conditions healed / People
  who were suicidal set free Dead raised to life / Arthritis conditions healed Broken bones healed instantly… and many more stories to be told. Christian and Melissa have now been on the Sunshine Coast QLD for 5
  1/2 years with C3 Noosa just celebrating its 5th birthday.  A church
  that is vibrant, growing, and impacting many lives in their local
  community and beyond. As this all still continues to grow and function
  Christian currently works part time for their church C3 Noosa and full
  time as a carpenter, building on job sites. Over the past 8 years Christian has
    suffered with pain in his body from a gradual degenerative arthritic
    condition in both his hips. In the past 4 years the pain has become
    very intense with major side effects such as only being able to
    sleep a couple of sound hours a night, having limited movement,
    unable to exercise or do the physical things he loves to do and
    especially with his kids. Two years ago Christian had the
    opportunity to go over to the U.S to get stem cell treatment in both
    hips which has helped to a small degree but has not been able to see
    the full benefits due to his current working activity of being on
    the tools building. Building over the last few years
      has taken a huge toll on his body and made the pain more intense.
      Christian has now come to a place where he cannot physically
      continue to do his work labouring as a builder, due to the extreme
      pain and limited movement. He has no other option left other than to proceed with
      further treatment being a double hip replacement! A double hip replacement and the extensive rehabilitation
        involved is quite costly and the road to full recovery is a good
        6 to12 months! In a matter of days Christian will have no income from building as he has had to give notice and quit due to his bodies inability
    to function sufficiently in the way needed to perform his role as a
    builder and his bodies pain levels have reached a crippling level. Christian needs our help NOW! The results from this will be amazing! It will give Christian back his quality of life! It will give
      him back the things that we take for granted like having a full
      night’s sleep, having no crippling pain, being able to exercise,
      and the ability to do normal life activities with his children
      while they are still young! We would love to enable Christian to get this surgery done ASAP
      and for him to have the appropriate time required for a full recovery. It is a costly procedure and the post-operative rehabilitation
      expenses required will be quite high. To enable Christian to have the procedure and the necessary
        time off not needing to labour physically in the building
        industry is a minimum of six months..... So that’s what we have
        based the amount of funds needed to raise on: - The double hip
        replacement surgery, rehabilitation and physical therapy for six
        months and funds to keep the family afloat while Christian is
        unable to work. So we kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless
        Christian and his family at this time as they make plans towards
        treatment, surgery and rehabilitation. Christian has been such a faithful servant and blessing to so
      many lives over the years. A servant’s heart through and through
      and one of the most generous people you will ever meet. If you are reading this then you have probably been blessed in
        some form either directly or indirectly from the big hearted
        kindness of this faithful man. We now we get the opportunity to sow back into this rich soil of
    an amazing family and help them in their time of need! They are so humble and never complain most people wouldn’t even
      know about this ongoing struggle over the years and how Christian
      has been enduring such pain in his body while going about blessing others! Let’s all band together to quickly raise the funds for this
        much needed surgery! If we all dig deep, give what we can and pass this on to our
        various friends and networks then Christian will be on the road
        to recovery before we know it... Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations.... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1MWCb

  than later! An Everest base camp trek is the adventure of a lifetime. The path
  begins in ancient Kathmandu, where I'll acclimate anticipate my
  ascent. My trek to Everest Base Camp at 5,364m (over 3.5 miles!) to
  the base of the world's tallest mountain will take me over suspension
  bridges spanning chasms of thin air, through hidden Buddhist
  monasteries, and into the heart of the warm, rugged Sherpa culture. It's going to be a 15 day climb with the biggest difficulty being the
  altitude and the long length of time. A lot of training is required beforehand, which I'll be commencing
  this December in preparation for April. — Read more info on Rachel’s story here: Rachel is extremely unwell. Without treatment, the prognosis is
  devastating; a slow and painful death due to her body shutting down progressively. This treatment is the last hope there is to save her life. Rachel has exhausted all avenues in Australia and has one last shot
  for treatment in Austria. Living on a Pension with her single mother means that there is no way
  she could ever afford the treatment. Thank you for your time. I'll keep you informed with Rachel's
  progress and I can’t wait to share this adventure with you all. **Pls Note: When donating, pls note there is an option to pay a

  taller than my dad now and has been able to beat me in wrestling for
  years. He likes normal tweenage boy things like Dungeons and Dragons
  and Minecraft. He also loves to read and is a total softie
  around cats and babies. He can fix or build anything. We're betting
  he's going to be an engineer one day. He's currently a red belt in
  taekwondo. He's very emotional and gets down on himself easily when he
  messes up. He has a heart bigger than a house. He helps my mom with
  anything and everything she asks for. He likes to take care of people.
  I've seen him cry so many times when he's unintentionally hurt
  someone's feelings, or when someone says something hurtful to him.
  This kid is smart . He plays the trombone in his school band.
  He has a heart of gold . You can't get such a special kid a pack of socks and a book and call
  it Christmas, especially when you haven't seen him in 6 months. So what do you get him? I had no idea where to start, so I asked him what he wanted. His
  reply is a true testament to his sweet character: ""I want you to
  come home and take me on an adventure!"" An adventure for Christmas! Now I was left with the question of what
  would the best Christmas adventure be? Then I smiled as the idea came:
  EnChroma. I had seen the viral videos, as I'm sure you all have. Tyler
  is red-green colorblind! What better way to show this sweet brother of
  mine something totally new than give him the gift of color? I want so badly for the brilliant light display in my hometown to be
  Tyler's Christmas adventure. I want to give him at least a portion of
  the joy he's brought me in my life for being my little brother. All donations will go directly and solely into making that dream come
  true, and changing Tyler's world forever. I feel uncomfortable asking
  for something I have not earned, but Tyler has definitely earned 10
  times over a pair of EnChroma glasses. This is all for him. So for his sake, I'd like to ask you all to please donate. If
  everyone who sees this were to donate just one dollar, I'd have enough
  for Tyler's gift in minutes. I'm paying all I can, but as a struggling
  college student it's just not enough. Every little bit helps. Please
  donate for Tyler. Please share this for Tyler. I want to give him the
  adventure of a lifetime for Christmas, and all I want to get is to see
  his smile.",https://fundrazr.com/31RAK0

8000,Please Help Olesia Walk Again,Russian Ruble,700 000,3,1%,"Hi there! My name is Olesia, and I extremely need your help. I know
  there are too many stories like this on the internet these days, so,
  all I hope for is that you read this to the end, and then decide
  whether you want to support my cause. Any tiny bit of your help
  counts, including advice. In 2015, I had to undergo four spinal surgeries in a row. However, I
  never recovered, and even developed additional troubles. Since then, I
  can hardly walk with a walking aid. During these past three years,
  I've been basically left alone to deal with my problems, but not only
  did my efforts to get back on my feet prove useless, my condition has
  actually even aggravated, and slowly keeps doing so. These days, I
  barely leave my apartment. Basically, I cannot leave it without
  someone's assistance. What makes it even harder, I can neither sit not
  stand for long because of strong back pain and increasing numbness in
  my legs. In my country, the doctors are rather skeptical about my condition,
  which is awfully discouraging. However, I started searching for
  opportunities abroad, and found this one surgeon willing to try and
  help with my case: http://www.dr-bertagnoli.com He believes that, most likely, another surgery is needed to solve at
  least part of my problems. But so far, it is only a question of
  thourough examination to establish the treatment strategy. Anyway, he
  sees chances of improvement, and after hearing 'no way' for so many
  times, it is really like a breath of fresh air. However, here I stumble upon another predictable problem: money. The pre-surgery examination will cost EUR 10,000 to 13,000. The surgery, if all is fine and it follows, is roughly estimated
  at EUR 130,000. These are amounts I cannot possibly afford. And then again, I
  don't even know yet how much I'll have to spend on my recovery
  afterwards, nor how long it will take. I have to admit that money was never my life priority. I probably
  never had much, but I used to think I had enough. Now things prove me wrong. I have been trying to collect the necessary amount with the help
  of friends, acquaintances, friends of friends, etc. But it is still
  not enough. Also, I have to deal with my running expenses, which has
  become tricky, too. Being currently unable to work, and with a monthly
  disability allowance of less than USD 130, I have already come to the
  point where I barely cover my basic medical bills. I keep looking for and trying every opportunity I come across. I keep
  searching for other, better, and hopefully more affordable, options.
  But there are none so far. I desperately want to walk again. I know that, even with all the
  empathy, you can't quite understand the feeling. I hope you can't. The
  only way for such understanding is to go through similar kind of
  experience, and it's really something I wish no one ever had to do. It's not just the physical pain. I am the kind of person who
  likes to spend a lot of time on foot, who manages to do everything
  while walking – reading, studying and working included. Or rather, I
  used to be this kind of person. In a stressful situation, or just to
  sort some thoughts out, I would always go for a walk, and I could
  spend hours like this. Now, I am deprived of this opportunity, as well
  as of many other things I appreciated so much in my life. I also feel
  very old, since I invest most of my time in treating my deseases and
  talking about them. Every day I wake up broken, and every day I
  have to get myself together again. I don't want to be like this. Nor do I want to be a burden on my
  parents' shoulders. Honestly, I could never have thought that, at my
  age, they will have to take care of me, not vice versa. I strongly believe that in the modern world, where they manage to
  help fully paralyzed people, there must be a possibility for me to
  recover, if not fully, then to a certain extent. I just should somehow
  get access to this possibility. I just have to use every chance to
  improve my condition, no matter how unattainable it seems. But, in any
  case, I can't do it on my own. Not anymore. I have already exhausted
  all my resources. All I can do now is count on support from others and
  hope it will all somehow work out. I hope that you take part in this and give me a chance. Thank
  you in advance for your help! I do appreciate it greatly.",https://fundrazr.com/pleasehelpolesia

  Ashram Gandhi - a place that, to many of us, has become sort of a
  Balinese home, nurturing our bodies, minds and hearts. During the last year, I have visited the Ashram five times and every
  time I went, it became a bit more like home. One of the key reasons
  for that is Pak Sadra's presence, care and welcoming spirit. He has
  not only given me acupunctural treatments, but welcomed me and my
  family at his home in Tenganan. He enriched my mind and spirit in our
  conversations about religion, philosophy and his travels. In fact he
  has become like a father to me, as he has to the Ashram members and
  many, many others. In early November, Pak Sadra's health condition deteriorated bruskly,
  and it required a surgery in the end in order to treat a very painful
  prostate inflamation. This process and required hospitalisation
  thereafter has exhausted his life savings of 2.500 USD completely, as
  the insurance did not cover the intervention at the hospital he was attended. Pak Sadra, who as been healing everybody in need, no matter their
  economic circumstances, now needs our support to be healed himself.

  back to healing others! With his campaign, we will send 100% of the raised funds directly to

300,For Willow Health,U.S. Dollar,35000,1,1%,"11-month-old Willow is the first child born to Natalie and James
  Crowe of McDonough, GA. They were so excited to welcome a baby into
  their family and could not have felt more blessed. Nine months ago,
  Willow’s mom noticed several bumps pop up on her back and belly which
  their Pediatrician thought were hormone bumps or possibly a heat rash.
  Willow was prescribed steroid cream, but after no change, they
  returned back to the pediatrician’s office, only to be diagnosed with
  eczema. After trying a different steroid cream with no real results,
  their doctor gave them a referral to be seen by a pediatric dermatologist. Willow was seen by two different dermatologists who both claimed her
  symptoms to be eczema related. To get a more accurate diagnosis, a
  biopsy was done of the main rash on Willow's back, but the results
  still pointed to eczema. Willow visited many different pediatric
  dermatologists and tried all their suggestions. After countless creams
  and lotions, bath washes, laundry detergent, steroid creams, EXTENSIVE
  diets for Natalie who was breastfeeding, and for Willow, there was
  still NO noticeable change. Willow continued to suffer as the rash on her back had become
  increasingly irritated and painful. She was put on two new medications
  that finally offered some relief but did not clear up the rash. She
  was also placed on an oral steroid that helped clear the rash on her
  back, but the bright red bumps in her groin area did not improve. At
  Willow’s next dermatologist appointment, her doctor asked for the
  bumps on her groin to be biopsied. The Crowes got the call with the results. It was Langerhans Cell
  Histiocytosis (LCH). Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a disorder in which the body
  makes too many dendritic cells. These cells play a role in the body’s
  immune system. Langerhans cells are a form of dendritic cell, or
  histiocyte, which is mostly found in the skin, lungs, stomach and
  intestines. In LCH, these cells build up in various tissues and cause
  damage. LCH is not a cancer, but it shares similarities to some
  cancers and often requires treatment with chemotherapy.",https://fundrazr.com/Forwillowhealth
420,Please help us afford Brii’s weekly Medical/Rehabilitation expenses,Australian Dollar,8000,5,5%,"Brianna’s journey started 14 years ago with constant pain at
  bilateral shoulders/scapulars, neck and chest. However specialists
  considered Brianna ‘too young’ to have anything seriously wrong with
  her. Brii was not taken seriously for these years, she was
  misdiagnosed and her complaints of pain and feeling generally unwell
  were ignored. This was extreme patient neglect that Brii experienced,
  when she should have had the support and guidance from specialists
  involved in her care. Many school days were held in bed due to the
  lack of investigations and diagnostics performed on her, leaving her
  with nothing but her pain. Over the course of these 14 years, Brianna
  put all her effort into becoming a Registered Nurse. She wanted to be
  a patient advocate, something she had not witnessed with her
  specialists. However, her pain was growing daily and Brii was having
  many shifts filled with pain that she could not explain. Although Thoracic Outlet Syndrome was not yet diagnosed, Brii started
  to experience severe bilateral chest pain- Chest X-Rays showed
  multiple rib fractures in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th ribs, bilaterally.
  The cause of these rib fractures were unknown. Bilateral 1st rib
  fractures were healing abnormally with lucent lesions, sclerosis and
  pseudoarthrosis. The right 1st rib was a non-union fracture with
  pseudoarthrosis in the shape of a football. The left first rib was
  connected to an extra rib, also known as a cervical rib at C7 via a
  thick fibrous sheath. However, even though scans were showing
  anomalies (abnormalities) in her body, doctors had no idea what
  exactly to do. After pain became so severe, it started to effect Brii’s life in more
  ways than one. She was seen by an immunologist who noticed a raised
  area at the side of her neck. This visible, raised area was the extra
  (cervical) rib protruding out. The immunologist performed an Adson
  Test and noted that when her arms were raised, Brii’s radial pulses
  would disappear. Brii was then referred to her first Vascular surgeon
  who performed further diagnostics and confirmed that indeed, Brii’s
  radial pulses completely flat lined when her arms were raised. She was
  finally diagnosed with a most severe case of bilateral Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. Surgery was performed immediately following diagnosis, 2 surgeries
  and 2 weeks apart from each other: 1. March 13th, 2017: Right Scalenectomy (removal of scalene muscles
  in the neck) and removal of multiple fibrous bands 2. March 27th, 2017: Left Cervical Rib Resection + First Rib
  Resection + removal of multiple fibrous bands and sheath + Scalenectomy Post-op recovery was to be 6 weeks and then return back to work as an
  ICU Nurse. Unfortunately, Brii was left with paralysis of the left arm due to a
  long thoracic nerve injury. This was noted via an EMG of the long
  thoracic nerve. This injury was due to the L) side surgery having been
  performed and caused serratus anterior palsy. A paralysis of the main
  muscle used to lift the  scapular, resulting in arms being able to
  raise upwards. It took many months for Bri to convince her surgeon
  that something was very wrong. Brii was unable to return to work,
  having only the ability to mobilise her right arm. On November 1st, 2017, Brii was admitted to hospital for a Left Pec
  Major Tendon Transfer surgery. A major surgery, splitting the pec
  major muscle and wrapping half around to the scapular bone. This took
  1 year to recover from, however during her recovery from this major
  surgery, she continued to experience severe pain on her R)
  supraclavicular fossa. Still, Brii was too sick to return back to work. Due to having had now 3 major surgeries in a space of 8 months, no
  specialist, including her original vascular surgeon, believed Brii was
  in such pain. The pain tracked from the right supraclavicular fossa,
  up the side of her neck, into her right side of jaw and to the
  occipital nerve region at the back of her head. Brii became bed
  ridden. What this pain was, was a complete blood circulatory occlusion
  at the Brachial Plexus (effecting the T1 nerve), Subclavian Vein and
  Subclavian Artery. Surgery was needed immediately. Finally, with the help of a new vascular surgeon, Brii was able to
  forget the pain by having a 4th surgery on July 20th, 2018- consisting
  of a Right First Rib Resection, Subclavian muscle resection, multiple
  fibrous band removal and large mass removed from her upper thoracic
  region. All of this was completely occluding blood flow on the right
  side, hence all her pain. As mentioned, Brii was only to have 6 weeks off work as an ICU nurse
  and it is now coming up to two years post 4 surgeries. We are only now making progress with the help of a new team of
  professionals; Head Coach and Exercise Physiologist, whom I am in
  contact with and strongly believe that with the help of her team, she
  will accomplish a full recovery with the hopes of no further surgery. Unfortunately, rehabilitation for someone like Brii is costly,
  requires a lot of time,effort and energy on a daily basis. For Brii to
  get well and return to work eventually, she must continue daily
  rehabilitation with her Exercise Physiologist and Team. This is an
  exhausting and long term process but with its benefits of making a
  full recovery. The rehabilitation Brii needs is very specialised to
  her specific case and due to her unique situation, a case study is
  currently being produced on Brii’s TOS specifically. We are asking for your assistance in helping to pay for Brii’s weekly
  rehabilitation expenses. We appreciate any support you can give us, so
  Brii can continue rehabilitation sessions. In regards to her current
  rehabilitation, our short term plan is to get her to a position where
  she can work one day a week, in order to get back into the workforce.
  Currently, Brii needs to gain more strength to cope with any form of
  work. She has been on a long journey and still has a long road ahead
  of her, however we have successfully found a Team that will support
  and guide Brii through this journey and we hope you can be part of it also. Thankyou.",https://fundrazr.com/DRDTOScasestudyBrii
4870,Steve Roberts: Cancer Treatment Appeal,Pound Sterling,75 000,84,65%,"My dear friend Steve Roberts has just been diagnosed with cancer in
  his prostate. I'm fundraising to help him and his wife Susanna afford
  the inpatient treatment he's been offered at the end of July at the
  Camphill Wellbeing Trust Medical Centre in Aberdeen and its follow-up
  maintenance programme. This intensive protocol is widely used in
  Europe and will double his chances of a good recovery by boosting his
  immune system as well as targeting the cancer cells. Donations of any
  size are vitally needed and will be much appreciated. Thank you! In most men, prostate cancer is slow growing and merely kept under
  observation but Steve's has an aggressive element that needs treatment
  to stop it spreading. The Gleason Score grades prostate cancers on a
  scale of 2-10 and his MRI and recent biopsy results reveal a Grade 7
  tumour. It is currently localised and Stage 2. As his beloved wife
  Susanna lost both her father and her mother to cancer they're
  determined to maximise Steve's chances by using conventional and complementary medicine this time. The intensive Mistletoe protocol at CWT Aberdeen is a holistic,
  plant-based, whole-person approach which, in our opinion and according
  to research and scientific evidence, strengthens the immune system and
  the life force while directly tackling the tumour. We believe it will
  give him the best chance of surviving this disease and retaining a
  good quality of life. When I met with Steve and Susanna last Summer at Emerson College,
  Forest Row (below) we were pleased to find each other looking so well. Steve had only just
  retired the previous December. His five-decade long working life was
  split equally between the written word (as a journalist, book &
  magazine publisher, editor and book seller) and curative education
  (first as a Carer and House Father in residential homes at Hohepa, New
  Zealand and Bristol, then as a teacher, Letter Press  tutor,
  Administrator and Trustee in special needs education). He and I met
  when we worked together in staff development for Ruskin Mill Trust at
  their Freeman College site in Sheffield, but he seems twice as busy in retirement. Steve is now on the verge of completing his first book - about
  Creativity and the Writer's Muse - with a second one planned (on
  William Golding and the double) while simultaneously organising an
  international conference on Nature Spirits, Elemental Beings and
    Human Cooperation scheduled for May 2019, and giving public
  talks and workshops on a variety of subjects. You will probably remember this fizzy
    combination of positivity, energy, enthusiasm and wide-ranging
    curiosity from your own dealings with him! Please help me to help this husband, brother, stepfather,
    larger-than-life Kiwi and inspiring friend to very many people
    around the world get on with the job of living his life to the full
    while trying to improve it for others. Every single penny donated will be spent
  on Steve's inpatient treatment in July, his ongoing home injection
  maintenance programme and his recovery. Your positive thoughts, prayers and messages of support are
      equally valuable. Steve's email is steveroberts1151@gmail.com . He is currently feeling fine and is his

    able to fullfil one of her biggest dream - to compete in a Latin
    dance competition abroad in Vienna in 6 months. She also needs to
    cover her medical bills, therapies and basic necessities. Whole story of what happened to Ana : This is Ana, my best friend of 12 years. She is an amazing
  competitive Latin and Ballroom dancer who won numerous competitions

  When we first met, 12 years ago, I didn't speak a word of English as I
  am a daughter of Czech immigrants who moved to New York a month before
  Ana and I met. She was the first person in this strange new place who
  made me feel like I belonged. Every day she would help me with
  homework and practise English with me. After 3 months of her constant
  help, I became nearly fluent. A week ago, something unthinkable happened to Ana. Ana was returning home from a dance practice. She lives in a fairly
  safe neighborhood and her dance studio is within walking distance from
  her flat. It was almost midnight by the time she took off. Ana doesn't
  remember the exact moment she was ambushed, nor what happened after
  that. The doctors say this is either due to a concussion she suffered
  after being hit on the head by her attacker or it's something they
  call ""motivated forgetting"", a defence mechanism in which
  people unconsciously forget traumatic events. They say its not
  impossible for Ana to regain some of her memories. Ana was found unconscious the next morning. She was rushed to the
  hospital where she regained conciousness. She was sexually assaulted, repeatedly hit on the head, stabbed four
  times, beaten and bruised. While her physical injuries are not
  life-threatning, she suffers horrible PTSD and various other mental
  problems. It breaks my heart to see her like this. I am absolutely sure, however, she will not give up and eventually
  she will recover. There is a dance competiton abroad in Vienna which
  Ana was training for, for over a year. It is one of her biggest dream
  to be able to compete there. The competition is in 6 months and we are
  all hoping she will recover quickly enough to make it to Vienna in time.",https://fundrazr.com/31RZE7
650,"Carol’s Plea for help with prescriptions, medical bills, food",U.S. Dollar,34 000,6,19%,"Hi, my name is Carol. It has been a rough
  road for me lately. A lot worse than the past. This year has been like
  living in hell. You see I became ill in the summer of 2008 with
  several chronic illnesses. They cause horrific pain. Only people who
  have one of these illnesses or are a friend or family member will know
  about them. You see they involve the women’s pelvic floor, muscles,
  nerves, organs etc. I have tried everything possible, all the while
  working to support myself, although I was married. I had to pay half
  of our housing costs and groceries but had to pay for all my own
  health insurance, medical bills, prescriptions, clothing, etc by
  myself. It took all the money i had saved for retirement which wasn’t
  much but it kept me afloat. But yet i had a husband buying
  materialistic things. As the years went by my whole life
  revolved around the pain from these debilitating illnesses. Some days
  worse than others. Many hospital visits, tests, medications and
  procedures followed. In all this time i was only out of work for 8
  weeks and a time of unemployment due to being laid off. The illnesses
  i have can be called invisible because you can’t see them like a
  broken arm. They are called Interstitial Cystitis, IC for short,
  Vulvodynia, Pudendal Neuralgia and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction. I also
  have an illness call Gastroparesis, it’s where your stomach doesn’t
  move the contents and i have to take medicine to help it move out of
  my stomach. All the medicines for these illnesses are costly, some
  over $100.00 each. At times i have had to stop taking them. Then last November i filed for divorce
  which my husband had wanted since 2005 but never filed. I got tired of
  the manipulation, controlling of me, verbal, emotional, mental and
  what i now learned financial abuse. At my age of 66, 67 in Jan I don’t
  have time to waste any more. Believe me I've tried everything. I was
  the one who ended up in counseling many different times. I am happy
  about the divorce, scared of what will become of me, but God says,
  “Guard your Heart,” that is what i am doing. I have kids, grandkids,
  some friends and my great group of Christian friends who keep me
  going. I also belong to a few FB groups dealing with different things
  i am going through who have helped immensely. Yes my story is long but
  needs to be told. Their are countless others going through some of the
  same things. I would like this fundraiser to help me but also raise
  awareness of these diseases to others. Men can get them to but not at
  the percentage of women. God bless us all. I want to be able to help
  people understand these illnesses by starting a group of some kind. I
  want to get better enough to be able to do this but I cannot without
  the proper medications. I want to thank anyone and everyone who
  donates to my fund. It will be such a blessing for both of us.",https://fundrazr.com/cleansenreclaim
100,Get Leo on his feet,Euro,2000,2,5%,"Leo was born premature - at 29th gestation week after urgent
    cesarean with only 810g (1.80 pound). Despite very low expectations
    for survival he proved to be a big fighter. Due immaturity he had to
    be connected to ventilation, to help him breathe, he had 8 blood
    transfusions during his first 3 months. Due numerous
    intubation/extubation attempts, with last one leading to
    resuscitation, as his lungs have torn (pneumotorax) because of the
    high pressure of ventilation machine. Therefore he had tracheostomy
    done day before he was supposed to be born, to prevent similar
    scenarios. We spend another 2 months at NICU, connected still to
    ventilation, then to oxygen. After long 5 months at hospital, we
    were finally sent home for first time, with oxygenator, so his blood
    and body get enough oxygen. Resuscitation led to lower oxygen level
    in the brain. Leo has due to to all these factors ( prematurity,
    resuscitation, oxygen therapy etc..) low muscle tone and has been
    diagnosed with central coordination disorder and needs daily
    rehabilitation (among the endless list of other diagnosis). There is a specialised private rehabilitation centre, which is
    leading expert in this field and is also specialising in
    rehabilitation for premature babies from early age. Unfortunately,
    this is not covered by health insurance and has to be paid privately
    by parents, although it has been proven, that the progress has been
    enormous and it actually really helps kids with their problems. We dont want, that Leo cant receive treatment, which could
    actually help him to start to move ( turn around, crawl, walk etc.)
    because of the money, so we are trying to find the money for this
    treatment, wherever possible. One treatment costs around 1500 Pound,
    and we are suspecting ( according to the other similar stories )
    that we would probably need to have at least 3 treatments during
    this following year. But one step at the time, we would like to
    start with the first treatment as soon as possible, and then worry
    about the financing the other 2, so that he can at least profit and
    improve with his delayed development in this time. We have already reached some success with daily 24/7 home care,
    we provide for him ( no help form the state). After long time, we
    have taught him to feed orally, so after 1 year, we could finally
    remove the nasogastric tube from his nose, he was fed with. He has
    finally begun to smile and laugh ( we waited for so long for this
    moment). Although we still cannot hear his voice because of the
    tracheostomy, hopefully as he grows, and we solve the problem with
    his airways, we would hear him to make some sounds. We could
    disconnect him from his oxygen machine after 9 long months being
    connected to all the tubes and cables, and he is able to breathe
    alone. So again he is proving us every day, that he is a fighter and
    that if we help him on his journey, devote our time, energy and
    everything, he gives it thousand times back. We would appreciate every help and are thankful to everyone, who
    is willing to help.",https://fundrazr.com/Getleoonhisfeet
1595,Help Nadia pay for gender affirming surgeries,Euro,4000,47,40%,"Hi there. My name is Nadia . I'm a neurodiverse
  transgender woman of color living The Netherlands. I was assigned male at birth, but for most of my life, especially
  since I started puberty I've been suffering from crippling dysphoria regarding my gender. Along with my ADHD , this led to me developing chronic
    depression, anxiety and agoraphobia in my late teens and
  young adulthood. Eventually I couldn't take it any more and realized
  that the only way I could ever be truly happy is to transition and start living as my most authentic self. I’ve lived in this body for 31 years, of which only the last 3 I've
  been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) . This,
  along with things like permanent laser facial hair
  removal has gone a long way towards helping me look and feel
  like the woman I know I am. But there's only so much that hormones can
  do. It can't fix the parts of my body that cause me the most
  dysphoria. Only surgery can change those. When I first started transition, I didnt want to rush into any
  surgeries. After all, they're scary, permanent, invasive and very
  expensive. I was hoping HRT alone would be enough. But over the past 3
  years the pain I feel regarding these specific aspects of my body has
  been constant and persistent regardless of how much
  self love I try to practice. It’s not something that’s just
    going to go away on its own. Deciding on getting these procedures isn't a decision I made lightly.
  It came after years of deliberation and trying everything else I could
  think of to make this feeling go away. Over the past 9 months especially, my mental health has gone down the
  drain. A lot of the time I'm too scared to go outside by myself,
  because how transphobic society can be to someone like me. My loved
  ones, family members, and partners have noticed how much worse I've
  gotten. I've been feeling hopeless, gross and most of all stuck. Like
  I'm unable to move forward in any way. Just like my decision to come out and transition, the decision to get
  rid of my facial hair using laser hair removal, the decision to go on
  HRT, having these surgeries really is the best
  option. It’s the next step I need to take in my transition. Please consider donating if you’re able to. It would mean
      the world to me and you’d be helping me out in a big way. If
      you’re unable to donate please share the link as much as possible. Thank you. <3",https://fundrazr.com/helpnadia

    the last thirteen months. Mrs Claus has been in and out of
  the hospital since September of last year with bowel problems and a
  relapse of her cancer. She first found out that she had cancer seven
  years ago. Her present prognosis is,
  ""Months"". Her nutrition is not where it needs to
  be, because of a fistula from her September 2011 operation and they
  recently found multiple cancerous nodules in her intestines. An
  operation and/or further Chemo are not an option. While he has medical
  insurance, his deductibles, co-pays, out of pocket, and non covered
  expenses have mounted into the thousands... in fact combined, they are
  over $10,000. Dad has always been a private man and pride has held him
  from begging for help. After some coercing, I convinced him (my Dad) to use FundRazr to help
  find relief from some of the financial pressure without disgrace. By setting the campaign goal at $8000, Santa Meekhanthong will be able to take care of all but two
  accounts that he can make reasonable payments that will not
  squeeze him to the wall. My personal goal is to abolish all of his
    medical obligations as it will soon be a new year. A new year will
    bring new deductibles and new out-of-pocket caps, along with the
    payments on the two accounts, plus supplies that are not covered by
  insurance. If we can surpass our initial goal, Santa Meekhanthong insists that gifts must be used to only
  cover medical expenses and therefore, he insists that anything above
  paying medical debts (10k ) must be donated to Relay for Life (an
  American Cancer Society charity event). So, my true goal would
    be approximately $10k... of coarse more would help us help Relay. Can You be part of our Team? We need a few people

15004,Help Grandmother Josephine Mandamin restore her full health and well-being.,Canadian Dollar,15000,165,100%,"WATER IS LIFE! Nookomis Josephine Mandamin is seriously ill and we want to
      help her recover her full health. We are Water Docs and our mission is to evoke a
      spirit of reverence for water; to inform about threats that
      imperil water; to inspire citizen action to protect water. We
      believe that water ripples deeply in each of us and to stir that
      rippling is to awaken action. We also believe we are fully aligned
      with Grandmother Josephine and her mission. Since we are all connected to the water, we strive to follow
      the teachings and example of Anishinaabe Elder and Grandmother
      Josephine Mandamin, Ogichidaa Kwe of Wiikwemkoong Unceded
        Territory and of the Midewiwin Way of Life. Josephine has
        unselfishly petitioned for the healing and restoration of Nibi
        (water) for many years and as such, she has come to be known as
        The Water Walker. Leading by example these past many years,
        Josephine has walked around and blessed each of The Great Lakes
        and many other bodies of water. She has inspired the creation of
        and galvanized a network of Sacred Water Walkers and Water
        Protectors across Turtle Island (North America) and has
        encouraged all women and men to take up this work for the
        healing of Nibi and our great Mother Earth. Josephine is far too humble to
      ever ask for help but contributing to her barrier to wellness is an unresolved issue arising
      from her past work through OI Leasing and Native Leasing Services. Former employees of OI Leasing
      were straddled with suffocating tax debt from years of service
      working for First Nations people off reserve. Revenue Canada (CRA)
      took these people to court for uncollected income tax and lost,
      but had the ruling overturned and began aggressively
      pursuing First Nations defendants for back taxes, interest and
      accrued penalties. More background information on
      this case can be found here. Since June 2018, some work has
      been done to relieve former employees of tax interest and
      penalties. If she is successfully reassessed, her current $59,000
      claimed debt may revert back to the original tax amount of
      $32,000. In the meantime, we are hoping to raise enough money to
      assist Josephine to relieve her of this unfair financial burden.
      So far, through the effort of one of Josephine's spiritual sons,
      almost $10,000 has been raised toward this cause. The situation has become a
      cause of stress for Grandmother Josephine and her family and, we
      believe, an impediment to her full rest and the recovery of her
      health and well-being, and her peace of mind. The CRA has threatened her and
      has been garnishing her hard-earned pension, which has affected
      her ability to meet household expenses. She lives on very humble
      means, while still travelling here and there when able, always
      continuing to work for the People and for the Water. She has unselfishly dedicated
      years of her life to others from her work for the Ontario Native
      Women's Association; her work as an Elder when she was raised up
      in the Lodge; to her calling as a Water Walker and birthing of the
      Sacred Water Walks. She has inspired us to answer the call of the
      Water and take meaningful and dedicated action on behalf of Nibi.
      She is truly a respected Grandmother of the great Anishinabek Nation. After all these years of
      devoted public service, to gether we can end this
      outstanding issue for Josephine and her family once and for
      all. Collectively, we can certainly give back to her in this very
      tangible and meaningful way. Please consider donating any
      amount you can to help pull Nookomis out from this ordeal and back
      onto the path toward good health and happiness. Help us make the season of
      giving a wonderful way to show our gratitude, love and
      respect for this very special woman. For our Grandmother and for the
      Water... Chi Miigwetch.",https://fundrazr.com/GrandmotherJosephineMandamin

  to try. After much research, we decided to start with Stem Cell
  Therapy in Panama! The hope is that the stem cells will help in
  repairing some of the damaged areas of Kyla's brain. Stem Cell Therapy
  is not a cure, but we hope for improvement to help our little girl

    her Stem Cell treatment. So, now we are focusing on the costly
    alternative and intensive therapies that she'll need to reach her
    maximum potention after her Stem Cell treatment! Cerebral Palsy makes everything Kyla tries to do challenging. She is
  not able to roll over, crawl, or sit up. CP affects the brain and
  nervous system functions, such as thinking, seeing, hearing, learning,

  and a bathroom which can be kept exclusively her own and sanitized
  daily, would go a long way in helping her fight against the cancer,

  Vestea a căzut ca un trăsnet asupra ei și a familiei. Însă cu
  optimismul care o caracterizează, cu ajutorul prietenilor și al lui
  Dumnezeu, a câștigat lupta. Viața a reintrat în normal; copiii s-au

  primă investigație și o operație (tentativă nereușită) de salvare a
  unuia dintre rinichi, planul de bătaie înseamnă șase săptămâni de

  went back to normal; the kids grew older, so did the parents. Now the
  disease is back and has already reached a kidney, the right-hand
  ureter and the iliac vein. Once again, Oana needs our help. Now she’s at the Helios Klinikum in Berlin. After a first
  investigation and a failed surgery to save one of the kidneys, the
  approach means 6 weeks of radiotherapy, possibly combine with chemo.
  Surgical removal of the tumor is not possible because of the location. The said therapy exceeds the financial means of her family. We need EUR 15,000 . Her children and husband want her back

1455,Boitano Support Club - Liz Kicks Cancers A$$,U.S. Dollar,4000,18,36%,"Liz, Joe, and beautiful babe Ryan, have had a crazy past couple of
  months. What started out as exciting news of an addition to their
  family, turned into a molar pregnancy taking that joy
  away. After processing the loss, and surgery to remove the mass,
  Liz had her levels monitored regularly to make sure everything was on track. In mid January, Liz's levels started rising, so she was brought in
  last week for an ultrasound and chest X-ray. These confirmed that a
  mass had returned and she was scheduled for surgery the following
  Tuesday. In the meantime, a CT was ordered. Tuesday came and the CT
  showed that the tumor was malignant and had metastasized to her lungs.
  Surgery was no longer an option. Yesterday, February 7th, the doctor
  called and said they didn't want to wait to start treatment. A PICC
  line was placed and inpatient chemo started today. Her port will be
  placed on Tuesday. This has been a very fast and very intense ride for Liz and her
  family. Another outpatient surgery turned into a minimum of four
  months of chemotherapy; they will need a lot of support from family
  and friends. I'm asking all who know Liz, Joe and Ryan, those who don't but
  understand the long battle ahead, or those who simply have a giving
  spirit and the monetary ability, to donate whatever amount you can. Unplanned childcare costs, lost wages, deductibles, etc. will be
  building very quickly. For those who don't know her, Liz is one of the most incredible
  humans on this Earth. She is one of far too many facing this

  the emergency room dept after collapsing at home, while battling with
  what he was told by a walk-in clinic doctor, was nothing more than a flu. For 15 days, Paul was in a medically induced coma and on life support
  while doctors were frantically fighting to save his life!! Paul was infected by a bacteria called ""Invasive Group A
  Strep"", and went into Septic Shock after the bacteria infected
  his blood and his organs began to shut down, from Toxic Shock Syndrome
  (read more here: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/what-you-need-to-know-about-group-a-strep-infections/article34391674/ ). 5 out of 100,000 Canadians suffer from this per year. Paul is currently still in ICU at Scarborough General Hospital after
  being transferred there from Toronto General Hospital, and is at risk
  for organ damage in his lungs and heart, his kidneys are functioning
  at 0% capacity, and his lower limbs are at risk for amputation. He is
  currently on daily dialysis, and has not recovered most of his
  physical abilities. Paul is a healthy, 31 year old substitute elementary school teacher.
  He loves teaching younger children and especially loves sports, namely
  soccer, where he volunteered his time to coach 4 teams, ranging from
  ages 12 -16. He is also in the process of completing his
  professional refereeing licenses. Paul recently purchased his first home, a condo close to home, where
  he was planning to move in after completion in 2 years. Our mother has been by his side each and every day and night, leaving
  her job to do what a mother does, care for their sick child. Your help and generosity will ensure all of Paul and our family's
  future financial expenses and medical costs are covered, namely the
  3-6 months of rehab and prosthetic costs, Paul and our mother's time
  away from work (neither has any benefits), and you will also ensure
  Paul will not lose his first home that he worked very hard to obtain! Our little brother has kept his spirits up, and has fought so hard to
  get this far.... But a new fight begins with new challenges and
    a long road ahead... Please share your prayers and financial support

6095,Gift 4 Sight,U.S. Dollar,6000,22,102%,"My name is Eric and am a 52-year-old male from Florida. Father of 3 and a grandpa to an amazing little 3-year-old girl named
  aniah who is my everything. I am starting this campaign in the hopes of raising funds to get the
  surgery that I so desperately need to live a normal life again. I was diagnosed with subcapsular cataracts in both eyes that is
  taking away my vision and in my case, my vision is deteriorating
  pretty quick. this particular cataract can mature in years months or
  even weeks. It seems that some of the asthma medications I have been taking for
  years ADVAIR to help me breath contained steroids that years later
  would change my way of life in a way that I would have never imagined.
  you know your in deep trouble when you can't see your own face in the
  mirror anymore. At 52 I was just enjoying my 3-year-old grandbaby and watching her
  grow up and looking forward to seeing her attend the 1st day of school
  and school plays and just being her protector and best friend. without
  this surgery, I will not see her grow up and do those little things
  that mean so much. This surgery is very expensive 3500 per eye and I don't have the cash
  or the insurance to cover this surgery on my own so the only way I can
  restore my vision and have a normal life again is to ask for help.
  your small donation can help me get closer to getting the surgery I need. My situation is urgent that's why I am reaching out to family and
  friends to donate. my ability to focus is gone already. all I see is
  shapes bright light and lots of fog and it's so scary. I don't leave
  the house anymore the sun makes it worst and my hobbies of producing
  music and gaming are sadly over for me at this point. I can't read
  anything unless its a few inches in front of me and only out my right
  eye. my left eye no matter how close I can't read out of it.
  depression has also kicked in but trying to stay strong. the only
  relief I get is when I close my eyes to sleep. if I can get only one
  eye done I would be the happiest person in the world but the goal here
  is to get both done. I hope that you can find it in your heart to donate to my campaign so
  I can see faces vivid colors and blue skies again. most importantly I
  would be able to see my granddaughters face again. thank you god bless
  you all and have a great new year. John Eric Mendez",https://fundrazr.com/Gift4Sight
3695,Toni For LIFE!,U.S. Dollar,10 000,30,37%,"Just days before Christmas , Toni Williams recieved a diagnosis that
  was practically unheard of for a healthy, young, active wife and
  mother of 3.  At 41 years old,Toni was diagnosed with stage IV
  colorectal cancer that rapidly spread to other parts of her body. Only a few months prior, Toni was developing her best self, as well
  as hosting fitness and health related motivational groups promoting
  exercise and clean eating and encouraging others. She has always been
  active, motivated, selfless, hard working, and devoted to her family.
  All of this adding to the bewilderment of what was yet to come. Around August/September she started noticing something wasn't quite
  right. Being strong willed and stubborn as she is, her family
  convinced her to get checked out. Since November, Toni has been
  through doctor after doctor, countless appointments,  tests upon tests
  trying to find out what was causing her abdominal pain. After lengthy
  hospital stays and multiple misdiagnosis she was given the news we
  never thought we would hear. As you can imagine, all of this has created incredible financial
  strain on the family as a result of missed work, unexpected expenses,
  deductables, added travel costs, and endless copays. As well as her
  most recent critical surgery to remove the tumors in and around the
  colon, lymphnodes, and ovaries. As anyone could understand it is humbling to not only receive help,
  but even more so to ask for it. Therefore, I am glad to request your
  support for them at this time! Most importantly, we ask you to pray for Toni and her family as they
  move forward in this process, but also to please consider how you
  might help financially. Any amount is greatly appreciated!! In Toni's own words taken from her Facebook page.... ""I have since been able to turn things around and start a new
  path that I believe will result in VICTORY. I must say, I believe in
  God and I know now that he is leading and directing me each and every
  step. No matter the outcome He deserves any and all of the glory!"" On behalf of Toni's family, we are believing it is also her strong
  will and stubbornness that will result in total healing!!! Thank you in advance for all your love, prayer, and support❤ Please share with others who would like to support Toni! And use #toniforlife",https://fundrazr.com/toniforlife

  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests

3620,Team Incredible: Funds for Hadera's Bone Marrow Transplant,U.S. Dollar,12000,32,30%,"Please let me introduce you to Hadera.  He is a creative sketch
  artist, a cellist, an ROTC marine (in training), a big brother,
  younger brother, and a young man of faith.  He is my son and his life
  is precious to me and everyone in his family.  He was born fourteen
  years ago with Sickle Cell Disease. As a mother, I was devistated. The prognosis was not good.  I had a
  difficult time thinking about his future. But, over time, I learned
  how to care for him and that with appropriate medical care, he could
  have a future.  As he grew, my focus became how to teach him to care
  for himself and manage his illness as an adult. During one of his clinic visits, the doctor discussed the possibility
  of a bone marrow transplant for Hadera.  I had read about them but the
  idea of him receiving bone marrow from a stranger had risks and I
  wasn't comfortable with them.  Time passed.  I had another baby (after
  ten years), a healthy baby girl - no Sickle Cell Trait or Disease. 
  Nothing!  Again, during a routine clinic visit, the doctor brought up
  the idea of a bone marrow transplant for Hadera. He thought that
  Hadera was a good candidate.  He suggested that each member of the
  immediate family be tested to determine if anyone could be a bone
  marrow donor.  Although the chances were low, we decided to have the
  tests done.  The best case scenario was that a direct sibling would be
  a 100% match. I wasn't very hopeful. I only had two other children and
  his father and I were not good candidates.  The testing was done at
  low resolution.  Within a few weeks, I received a call from the bone
  marrow clinic at Texas children's Hospital.  The nurse told me that
  there was a possible match in the family....Who was it?  It was his
  three year old sister!  I refused to get too excited.  We took her in
  for a high resolution test and within a few weeks, it was confirmed
  that she was a 100% bone marrow match.  Now what?  Well, tests were
  done, their weights were taken and it was determined that she was just
  too small to undergo such a procedure at that time.  So we would wait. A few months ago, the doctors announced that my daughter had gained
  enough weight and that we could now prepare for the transplant to take
  place in February.  Things began to happen quickly now.  Since the
  process includes chemotherapy, there was a risk of damage to his
  reproductive organs.  So we attempted sperm banking (It is
  inconclusive as to whether or not that will be useful or not at this
  time).  In addition, it was determined that if he and his sister had
  the same blood type, more of the stem cells from the bone marrow could
  be preserved (or rather nothing lost).  Therefore, they their blood
  was tested and (low and behold) they are the same blood type! A few weeks before the transplant, I finally had to explain to my
  little four year old what she was about to do.  So I asked her,
  ""Do you know why your brother is in the hospital?"" and she
  answered, ""Yes because his blood is sick."" So I went on to
  tell her that she had superhero blood and then asked if she would
  please let him have a little of it.  After she thought for a few
  seconds, she said, ""okay.""  Around that time, she kept
  asking for the Jack Jack doll from the recent Incredibles movie. So it was bought for her.  That
  got me thinking about how incredible our story was .... she was.
  Incredible.... yes like the movie! A few days before the transplant,
  she requested the Incredibles costume (of course).  So I quickly
  purchased it and she would wear it on the day of the surgery. From
  that day on, we became Team Incredible. On February 9th, Hadera was admitted to Texas Children's Hospital BMT
  unit to begin chemotherapy that would destroy his diseased bone
  marrow.  He tolerated the process well with few side effects.  The
  following Wednesday, February 20th, his four year old sister was
  brought in to the hospital to have her bone marrow stem cells
  harvested. My prayer was that the doctors would be able to harvest
  more that what they needed, so that a less desirable ""Plan
  B"" would not be needed.  After the surgery, the cells were
  processed and counted, and; it was determined that they had collected
  an excess of the cells that they had expected.  I almost cried right
  there in the hall as the doctors made their monumentous announcement. 
  That same evening, the precious stem cells were transplanted into him
  while we all sat and watched. Although the transplant is complete,  the important waiting process
  has begun.  The new stem cells must engraft into Hadera's body and
  become his own.  Until then, he has no functioning immune system and
  is extremely vulnerable to infection and disease.  Until engraftment
  is complete, he must remain in Texas Children's Hospital for at least
  three to four more weeks. After that, he will be quarantined at home
  for several months to allow his new bone marrow to grow and immune
  system to develop.  The success rate for this treatment is above
  ninety percent which gives us reason to celebrate. Bone marrow transplant is extremely expensive and will cost thousands
  of dollars. Therefore, we are hoping that this cause will resonate
  with you.  Thank you for supporting Team Incredible.",https://fundrazr.com/51SuHa

8988,Zach Branson Liver Transplant Fund,U.S. Dollar,50 000,72,18%,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 32.5 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work

  of an extremely rare bone tumor (desmoplastic fibroma), and have
  decided to embark on a journey to create more awareness and provide
  funding for more research for these rare tumors to help physicians and
  patients better understand these conditions, procedures, and treatment/recovery. I am currently recovering after undergoing a more aggressive/radical
  treatment after a 2nd recurrence of this tumor (in my right femur, as
  pictured) to replace my knee as well as half of the femur - the
  typical treatment for malignant osteasarcoma (my 5th operation in
  total).  This is pretty much a testament to how aggressive and
  grueling these tumors are, whether they are benign or not - that the
  treatment is similar or can be identical to that of a cancerous growth
  of the bone. These tumors happen in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life; therefore,
  the majority of individuals enduring this pain, multiple operations,
  and lengthy recoveries are in their childhood, teens, 20's and 30's.
   These are ages that are supposed to be the most active, fun, and
  joyful for youngsters and able-bodied people to be exercising, playing
  sports, etc.  Surgeries can be extremely invasive, painful, and
  continual. My goal is to create more awareness of these tumors that are vary
  rare (they make up approximately 2% of all tumors) and there are only
  about 120-200 orthopedic oncologists in the United States able to
  treat these rare growths.  Not to mention, in major cities and
  teaching institutions, rather than equally spread throughout - making
  it difficult for some patients to travel to see exactly who they need
  to see. I'd like to be able to create a community where survivors of
  these tumors can share their experiences with one another and provide
  support, as well as to start a fund that will benefit research toward
  a particular body of medical science that will be dedicated to
  learning more about muskuloskeletal lesions/tumors. For more information about bone tumors, please visit www.bonetumor.org . EVERY dollar counts.  Many

9349,Road to Healing: Help Col with treatment and life!,U.S. Dollar,42000,95,22%,"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved

  participé, qui participent, et qui participeront a cette campagne de
  socio-financement. Bravo a vous tous, vous faîtes réellement une
  différence dans nos vies (surtout celle a Philip, mais aussi pour les
  gens qui l'entoure et qui s'inquiète). Près de 5,600$ ont été
  ramassé jusqu'à présent! Philip reprends du poil de la bête depuis les derniers traitement de
  chimiothérapie de cette hiver. Motivé , Philip cherche a réintégrer le
  marché du travail pour la saison estivale, afin de rester actifs et engagé. Un petit changement d'air s'impose, nous pourrons bientôt souhaiter
  la bienvenue a Philip, dans la capitale nationale ! _____________________________________________ Le 22 janvier 2019, Philip Simard-Léveillé, âgé de 21 ans, est
    diagnostiqué d’un cancer de l'hypopharynx de stade 3. Malgré la
    nouvelle, Philip garde la tête haute et les yeux pleins d’espoir; il
    est prêt à se battre. Pour ce type de cancer, les spécialistes
    estiment une durée de vie de 8 mois ainsi qu’un taux de réussite des
    traitements de chimiothérapie de 30%. Pour combattre la maladie,
    Philip a entamé ses traitements de chimiothérapie. Le type de
    traitement qu’il reçoit se fait par intraveineuse et la durée des
    traitements est de 12 heures par séance, toutes les deux semaines.
    Une fois une séance terminée, celui-ci doit immédiatement se
    retrouver en quarantaine dans un endroit aseptisé durant les 7 jours
    suivant le traitement. Suite à l’état difficile dans lequel les effets secondaires du
    traitement le laissaient, Philip a finalement pris la décision
    d’arrêter ses traitements, afin de profiter au maximum du précieux
    temps qu’il lui reste plutôt que de vivre alité et semi-conscient. Ayant perdu son travail dû au temps qu’il devait accorder à ses
    traitements et à son isolation, Philip doit toutefois continuer de
    manger et de payer son loyer et une inquiétude monétaire s’installe.
    Il est crucial pour la santé mentale de Philip de garder son
    indépendance, de rester autonome et d’avoir une vie active le plus
    longtemps possible. Une santé mentale forte est donc extrêmement
    importante afin qu’il puisse garder la tête haute. Positif, fonceur,
    travaillant, combatif et attentionné, Philip a besoin de votre aide
    afin de conserver son autonomie, mais aussi pour garder espoir. Les Fonds Les fonds que nous souhaitons recueillir pour aider Philip
    permettront de couvrir tous les besoins de base pour une période de
    12 mois: Loyer, hydro, nourriture, médicaments, déplacements,
    téléphone et Internet. Afin de conserver son autonomie ainsi qu’une
    vie active le plus longtemps possible, Philip a besoin d’amasser
    25,000$ afin de couvrir tous les frais et dépenses qui seront
    nécessaires au courant de l’année 2019. Une fois les frais de base
    couverts, Philip aura la chance de se concentrer sur sa ‘Bucket
    list’ et de vivre pleinement chaque instant. Vous pouvez aider Philip de plusieurs façons: - En apportant une contribution monétaire, peu importe le
    montant, afin de l’aider à rester autonome et ainsi lui donner une
    chance de surmonter la maladie, et de vivre ses rêves ; En partageant cette campagne à vos proches, ainsi que sur vos

515,Nakula (Neo) In need of urgent medical help for PTSD!,U.S. Dollar,18 000,9,29%,"Nakula (Neo) celebrated his 22nd Birthday! On April 29th, 2019! He woke up early that morning and I showed him all the
    donations that he had received from all over the world and he just
    could not believe the support he was receiving! Thanks so much, to everyone who has come forward so far to
    make life more wonderful for Nakula. Nakulas Story He has been suffering from severe PTSD for the past few years
    and he has just recently started taking high-quality CBD, and
    medications. He is receiving Hypnotherapy and professional medical
    attention and his condition is improving, yet in order for him to
    continue receiving the care he needs and
    professional psychological counseling on a consistent basis, we will
    need some help financially to cover all his medical expenses! He has started seeing a psychologist once a week in his house
    for PTSD symptoms which are pretty severe, because he could not make
    it into town for weekly visits, a house has been set up for him in
    the countryside where he has a volunteer working and living with him
    full time that is similar to a big brother mentoring situation. He is in desperate need of consistent mental health care and
    engaging in activities with kind-hearted people encouraging him in
    his healing process, step by step progress is being made. At this time it is difficult for him to leave the house so he
    gets isolated, he tends to get paranoid, depressed and fearful, then
    he doesn't want to leave the house. All the costs involved in his care are a bit difficult to
    manage, so we have decided to reach out and ask for help for him,
    and hope that collectively we can pull together and help him out so
    he can get the medical attention he needs to get better and thrive
    in life. How You Can Help If you want to make a donation one time or on an ongoing
    monthly basis of an amount that feels comfortable, it would be
    appreciated so very much at this time! We are aspiring to raise $300 a month on an ongoing basis or a
    total of $1800 to cover his costs for 6 months for his medication
    and in-home professional counseling costs in Costa Rica. The idea is that if everyone contributes a small amount
    monthly that this can be achieved. Monthly and one time donations can be sent on Paypal to yogaofbeauty@gmail.com If you have any questions in regards to setting up a monthly
    contribution please contact us directly at the above email address. There are also options on FundRazr to remain anonymous in
    making your donations. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help Nakula at
          this time and that we stand together as friends, and family
          near and far to help heal his PTSD. If we all give what we can and share this with our various
        friends and networks then Nakula 's healing
        journey will be made so much easier by us all joining together
        to show how much we care! Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations...",https://fundrazr.com/71RJb6
950,Help create balance on the planet through music,U.S. Dollar,25 000,12,38%,"Hi we're Ben & Cassie, founders of Soul Fit NYC, a wellness
  company dedicated to creativity, self expression and healing for all
  people on the planet. Early this year our friend Richard Miller, a brilliant Brazilian
  guitarist approached us about a concern and idea he had to solve it.
  He told us a little known fact: over 60% of professional musicians are
  forced to end their careers early due to injury. Richard knows that it
  doesn't have to be that way. Rather than feeling sorry for himself and
  those affected by injury, he took action. He created an idea for a
  healing retreat in the healing land of Costa Rica, especially for
  guitarists. It's called ""Balanced Guitar."" It's a retreat
  that addresses injury prevention through balance. With yoga, surging,
  Tai Chi, massage, guitar instruction and healing food, Richard knows
  he could make a difference. We loved the idea! Like Richard, Cassie and I saw the possibility of
  this retreat and the huge  impact and possitive benefits this retreat
  could have for anyone who participated (musicians or not). We hit the
  ground running and made Richards dream a reality. This January 5th-13th, Balanced Guitar will happen in the healing
  land of Nosara, Costa Rice. Students from all walks of life and
  economic backgrounds will study guitar technique from brilliant
  teachers like Freddie Bryant (Professional Guitarist, Professor at
  Berklee School of Music & Tai Chi instructor) & Richard Miller
  (professor at Columbia and Driectoe of Programming for the Afro-Latin
  Jazz Alliance in NYC). Iyengar Yoga will be taught by master teacher Rosa Santana. Thai
  Massage will be provided by Cassie Fireman. Surfing lessons will be
  taught by Richard Miller himself. Organic, home cooked meals will be
  cooked by local, Costa Rican chef: Robin. All this costs money and time. We have very little time remaining and
  we have more money to raise. We especially want to raise money to help
  send students to our retreat who can't afford it on their own. Please consider making a donation today. No amount is too small (or
  large) to make a difference. If if you or someone you know would like to attend the retreat, we
  have a few spots left. Check out our website at www.BalancedGuitar.com or email ben@soulfit.nyc for more information. Pura Vida, Ben & Cassie",https://fundrazr.com/815G31
3450,Please Help Marccelo!,U.S. Dollar,30 000,37,12%,"My name is Guissela, and I'm the mother of a miraculous little boy. 
  As a mother of 2 boys with very different disabilities, there is
  nothing more terrible than seeing your child in pain over and over
  again. Well for me it was my 14-year-old son name Marccelo. After 2 spinal cord surgeries, we thought we missed the bullet
      when we were granted a miracle after a surgery that helped him get
      stronger and able to finally take his first steps with a gate
  trainer . But just like that our happy little hero's
  progress stopped.  When Marccelo started 8th grade, he suddenly began to get weaker and weaker and lost the ability
      to control his neck and lower extremities .  He also lost his spirited smile . I can still hear him asking me, ""Mommy what's going on? Why can’t I move my hands?"" I wish I could have given him a positive answer so he
  could have felt better knowing there was something we could do about
  it. Unfortunately, we got the sad news that he would need yet another
  spinal surgery; only this time it would have to be a spinal fusion and his life would be in
      jeopardy. Marccelo could lose the little strength he has left and
      be put on a ventilator for life. I am still praying
  for the courage to take that risk. Marccelo was born on November 22, 2004, the week of Thanksgiving. I
  was thankful to God for giving me such a beautiful blessing. I was
  beyond happy and felt I was the luckiest mother alive. On the day of
  his routine 9-month checkup, the doctor gave me the first of many bad
  news to come. Marccelo needed to be seen by a specialist due to the
  fact that he was very floppy. I took Marccelo for an MRI where I was
  told that he needed a spinal decompression. At only 13 months Marccelo
  had his first spinal surgery. Doctors told me he would never walk, speak, eat and that he
      would live his life permanently in a wheelchair. At
  that moment my world collapsed. I couldn't understand why this was
  happening to me. My faith was tested and I was angry at God for what
  he was doing to my child. It was the saddest day of my life. I gained strength and decided to give my son the best life I could .  I was on a mission to prove the doctors wrong. So as Marccelo grew up, I never treated him differently, nor did I
  make things easy for him. I wanted him to give it his all so he could
  become independent and succeed in life. At the age of 3, he was able to sit up, use his little hands to
      sign, speak with difficulties, eat on his own and do many things
      regular kids his age were doing. Of course, the
  walking part was a bit difficult. Regardless, Marccelo learned 2 languages, his letters, colors and numbers
      before he went to kindergarten. I was so proud, and
  happy for him. I knew there was something special about Marccelo that
  went beyond the fact he was my son. He always had an incredible way to touch hearts and inspire
  love. He is compassionate toward those suffering and has
  always been a peace maker.  This is why I believed him when he told me
  he had an encounter with God. In 2017, just before Marccelo’s second spinal decompression, he
      shared his story about a guardian angel coming to
  him.  He described his guardian angel and a message God shared with
  him about helping other children get to heaven.  He told me he met my
  grandmother who passed away 28 years before, telling me she had a
  message for me.  She called me by my pet name and said things about me
  and our relationship that Marccelo was not aware of.  I get goose
  bumps whenever I share his story.  After the experience, Marccelo went into his surgery full of faith and optimism
    with an unprecedented recovery in spite of what the doctors had told
    me to expect. That was why we thought we dodged a bullet. Marccelo has always been a kid who enjoys every second of the day, is
  outgoing, and still believes in his dream of becoming a famous video
  game player or cop!  Making sure everyone is happy, he consistently
  finds the best in the worst. He is so loving and supportive to his
  older brother who has autism...and to me, encouraging me when I would sometimes be brought to tears when
      my body would give out while trying to lift his chair into the
  car. My body, never my will, because I know I need to
  continue to be strong for him and his brother. There are no limits to what I would do to see my son smile
  again. The pain of watching him go through this is
  insurmountable.  I would take it all myself if it would lessen it for him. Today we face a bigger challenge. I am trying to ready myself and Marccelo for his third spinal
      cord decompression and fusion surgery. I am praying
  he will not have to be on a ventilator for the rest of his life, but I
  have to be prepared in case the doctors are right. I admit, it is
  overwhelming. Not just because money is a big issue but because time is running out and a lot of changes have to be made to make
      it all happen before his surgery. Following is a
  list of what we desperately need.  Fortunately, I was able to take a
  few things off the list because insurance is covering them.  Insurance
  is not covering the following: A wheelchair with a head array so Marccelo can move around independently,
        having the autonomy to continue to learn and have some fun
        playing games . An accessible mobility van because as he gets older, he is getting heavier. I can’t
        carry him anymore because it is not safe. We need a one level home with a room big enough for his medical bed, lift, and any
        other equipment he might need after surgery, also with an
        accessible bathroom so he can move around. Marccelo is not the only kid in need; we are not the only family in
  need. I'm only a very tiny percentage who are blessed to have come
  across a tremendous network of people who are encouraging me to take
  this step of reaching out to others for help. We a beyond grateful for anything you can give to help us get
      through this. A forever thankful mom, Guissela",https://fundrazr.com/Marccelo1122
1480,We Support Nancy- Mental Health Funds,U.S. Dollar,3000,12,49%,"Nancy is an incredible activist, fighting for immigration
    justice, abortion access, and always speaking out for her community.
    She is also a survivor. The abuse she endured at the hands of an
    immigration organizer led to her hospitalization for suicide. She
    has been incredibly brave by sharing her story, including in the Austin Chronicle . After going public with the abuse, her abuser continued his
    controlling and abusive behavior by bringing a defamation suit
    against her. In the court documents, he made public parts of Nancy's
    story that were her right to share, not his. We believe Nancy. We
    support her. We love her. We are asking for help covering her legal
    costs so that she can keep sharing her story, on her terms, with our
    support behind her. Forcing Nancy to take on the cost of a lawsuit is an abuse tactic we
  cannot let her face alone. While it's unclear what the final legal
  costs will be, additional money raised will go to support the costs
  Nancy has accrued in the past several months securing her safety and
  well-being from her abuser. All funds raised go directly to Nancy. Court has been scheduled for May 29th. Legal funds are still needed
  to cover preparation and in the unfortunate case that this case
  continues. Our sincere hope is that this fundraiser will no longer be
  needed, but we'll have more information as Nancy heads to court to
  face her abuser. *credit for this beautiful illustration of our friend Nancy goes to
  Yunuén Sigler* **UPDATE** I won my legal case against my abuser. He was not able to silence me.
  Although my legal fees are over, there was still an incredible dent to
  my finances during this entire process and trying to attain mental
  health services has cost quite a bit. In order to continue accessing
  these services and the care I need for PTSD because of the case, I
  need assistance once again and I hope y'all can help me. Being
  incredibly vulnerable with my financial status and my mental health is
  not easy but I share this with y'all because I will not be silenced.",https://fundrazr.com/WeSupportNancy

      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this
        treatment. Protection of my girls, wisdom and patience for my
        husband, strength and peace for my mom, travel mercies,
        successful treatment, eradicating the cancer are just a few of
        the prayer requests I would ask of you. Thank you in advance for
        joining me in prayer. It is our most powerful weapon against the darkness. Psalm 46:1-7 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.[c] 4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 7 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

500,It all started with a Ray......,U.S. Dollar,400,12,125%,"It all started with A Ray.... and together we can make many more shine.... This all started with a Ray, our Ray, to be more accurate. My
      good friend, Claudia and I, had just moved her mountain Boutique
      to a new location and it needed a new fresh look. She brought in
      Ray, probably the gentlest and sweetest soul, to do the job.
      ""You pick it, I paint it"" he would say each day he came
      in. What I didn't know was that he wasn't just using a catchy
      slogan.  Over the week he spent with us I came to find our Ray is
      color blind and has been for the 76 years he has been on this
      wonderful world. Ray never had an opinion on the colors or chose
      them himself because he could not see the shades as we did. As I watched him carefully tape off the corners and windows
      and gentle apply the mint green and merlot red to our walls I
      realized that Ray would never be able to see how truly beautiful
      his work was. In between stories of his rowdy youth and extra
      coats of paint on the walls it dawned on me that Claudia and I
      could do something special for Ray to help say thank you for all
      his work.... EnChroma Glasses! So, I went online and started
    harassing all my friends and neighbors. SURELY! SOMEONE had to have
    a pair of those fancy glasses we could borrow. In my search a
    community member mentioned that there must be many more in our
    community that could benefit. The decision to start a fund for a
    permanent publicly available pair was made. All we needed to do was
    find a home where people could access them. Luckily, we didn't have
    to look far. Neighbor to the Boutique is Wild Bear Nature Center,
    Boulder County's only all ages, non-profit nature center. WILD BEAR NATURE CENTER Wild Bear Nature Center sees about
    27,000 visitors through its door every year. With a passion for
    re-connecting all ages with Nature as well as educating the
    importance of taking care of this beautiful earth, we believe that
    this is the home for our Enchroma glasses. THE PERFECT HOME.
    Utilizing Wild Bears ability to direct people to nature hikes, snow
    shoeing or one of their superb programs, we can create exceptionally
    magical mountain moments for Color Deficient seers that will last a
    life time. Imagine the oranges and reds of the Aspens to an eight
    year old who has never seen those shades before. Or imagine seeing
    the deep hues of our back country for the very first time for
    someone who has spent their whole lives in the Rockies. All the funds collected will be
      used to purchase a pair of EnChroma glasses that will be available
      for any one with Color Deficiency to rent free of charge. Any
      remaining funds will be used to make an exhibit for the center
      explaining Color Deficiency and Blindness as well as educating
      visitors how other animals see color. And of course we will have a
      special night with Ray, the reason this all started. Thank you for spending the time to
    read our story. We greatly appreciate any and all donations. WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

  today is a difficult time for our brother Lito, a single Dad, and his
  son, Ira Angelo. Lito has been hospitalized since January 31, 2019. As of today he is still in the hospital and needing urgent care. He
  was successfully operated on his acute Cellulitis on his neck. But as
  the doctors continued to care for him, they discovered he has
  Tuberculosis and now MRSA, which the latter is highly contagious. He
  is on 24-hour oxygen and being treated with an expensive drug for his
  MRSA. He would need medications and continued maintenance after he has
  been rehabilitated. The hospital bill has gone up to more than $4,000
  which does not even include the doctors’ fees. Our immediate family is
  helping in various financial capacities. We are hoping to get much
  needed help for Lito’s continued care and maintenance. Your help for Lito and his son Ira will be greatly appreciated. We

1360,Darrell & Caitlyn's IVF Journey,U.S. Dollar,30 000,18,5%,"Dear family, friends, and acquaintances, There are few who know or have heard the story of our
  infertility struggles. Together since high school, this fall marks 13
  years together, and in April we will be celebrating 6 years of
  marriage. While many known to us have lovingly asked when we plan to
  have children of our own, only those closest to us are aware of the
  painful experiences and heart wrenching losses having suffered four
  miscarriages, in which 2 were ectopic pregnancies. The first
  miscarriage unexpectedly occurred in 2008. Later in 2010, my wife
  discovered she was pregnant again, but days later experienced extreme
  pain. At the hospital, doctors discovered that her left tube had
  ruptured as a result of the embryo attaching to the tube which ended
  up needing to be removed. After coming to terms that pregnancy may be
  difficult with only one tube, she suffered another miscarriage in
  2013.  We were disheartened, but we didn’t lose hope even though her
  chances were less than the average. Unfortunately, in 2016 we found
  out we were pregnant again and the doctors closely monitored pains
  she  began experiencing yet again. It turned out to be another ectopic
  pregnancy and the doctor had to remove her right tube.  The result of
  both her fallopian tubes needing to be removed makes fertilization
  impossible to happen naturally. We were devastated to discover the loss of another
  baby, especially after hearing that we can no longer have children. In-Vitro Fertilization is a medical procedure that can help
  make it possible to start a family. Adoption has crossed our mind,
  however the process can cost more and take just as long, if not
  longer. The medical costs of the previous miscarriages,
  testing, and diagnoses have already been painful and difficult
  financially. We have looked at all options and learned how IVF may be
  able to help us with our situation. We now hope to make a trip to
  Florida this summer in June, to a fertility clinic that offers an IVF
  package that fits our needs. We have already taken steps to
  communicate with the friendly and helpful staff and are hoping to move
  forward with any pre-testing needed to be done as soon as possible.
  Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that an IVF cycle will be
  successful the first time, but this fertility clinic will allow us a
  chance at 6 IVF cycles. Generally, a single cycle of IVF ranges
  between $9,000 - $11,000 with medication that can add an additional
  $5,000 - $8,000. Sadly, IVF is not covered by insurance so these
  expenses will be out-of-pocket.  The money raised would be used to
  cover any medical testing, the IVF procedure, medication, airfare, and
  lodging. The success rates of IVF for my wife’s age range (29) is at
  its peak, and if we wait too long to attempt this procedure, success
  rates drop dramatically with age. The medical cost and conditions of IVF are compounded
  by the lack of access to facilities and care on island which have
  brought us both to a place that we had hoped we would not have to find
  ourselves asking for -asking for help from others. We both come from
  very tight-knit families, and we are grateful that they continue to
  support us by guiding us towards finding ways of making our dreams of
  starting our own family possible. My wife and I are working on saving what we can, but as
  you can see, the procedure is quite pricey. I am currently working two
  jobs to help make ends meet, and my wife is just short away from
  graduating with a degree in English Literature on top of full-time job
  as well. She has plans to become a teacher once everything falls in to place. Everyone has a different path, and for us things just
  come a bit later in life, but we’re continuing to work hard in
  reaching our goals. Any and all donations are greatly appreciated, and
  we thank you for taking the time to read our story. We understand that
  we all have struggles of our own, so even your prayers will be greatly
  appreciated during this time. Thank You and God Bless, Darrell & Caitlyn Pangelinan",https://fundrazr.com/darrellandcaityivf

  where we both used to work. We met because I needed help with a UA
  calendar problem - I couldn't get my events to save and it was
  important b/c I was in a marketing position at the time. She found the
  glitch and helped me out of a pickle. We've been friends ever since. Now, she needs help, and it's of a more serious nature. Shelley has
  been at Banner University Medical Center since the beginning of
  November, 2018, in the ICU. She nearly died an untimely death in her
  40's. She is a mother to a lovely daughter, who recently graduated
  college, & Shelley herself got married over a year ago to a
  wonderful man named Marcus Coltrin. Shelley has been diagnosed with
  idiopathic autoimmune necrotizing myositis. She is unable to speak
  with her actual voice right now, as she has had a tracheotomy and
  communicates using a laminated sheet displaying the alphabet and
  points to the letters in order to spell words. She will have to learn
  to do many things all over again - things that we take for granted.
  Her care in the ICU for about two months costs more than Blue
  Cross/Blue Shield will cover. To be blunt, Marcus and Shelley are
  worried about their rising medical bills when they should be focused
  on Shelley getting well. Please help Shelley and Marcus by contributing whatever you can to
  the costs of Shelley's medical care in the ICU AND also sharing with
  your friends. Shelley is a great friend, wife and mother. She would
  give the shirt off her back to anyone else in need, but she and her
  family need us now. With your help, she and Marcus can stop stressing
  about medical care costs and concentrate on what matters most:
  Shelley's healing, getting out of the ICU, and her improved quality of
  life with immunotherapy. Share this far and wide, and together, we can
  change their lives for the better! Thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/a1RSAb

  Youth Association's Sports Day. For those of you who don't know Hank & Jeannie Tate they have
  been sacrificial servants and loving on others the entire 44 years of

  homeschool community since they started homeschooling in 1984. They founded the Tomball Homeschool Support Group Hank co-founded the South East Texas Homeschool Association
    regional organization and served as President as they served over
    120 Support Groups. Hank co-founded the Gulf Coast Home School Conference and
    co-managed it for over 20 years. Over 2,000 people were blessed each year Hank taught the Beginner Homeschool 5 class series in Houston
    and around the U.S. for over 20 years. Over 350 workshops for over
    25,000 homeschoolers. Hank served on the Boards of HOPE for Texas, and the Texas
    Homeschool Coalition over 10 years. Hank and Jeannie have also served, and still serve, on the
    Board of the Homeschool Christian Youth Association (HCYA) over 20 years They have managed HCYA Graduation over 20 years. Hank is still
    managing Graduation. They have managed HCYA Sports Day over 15 years. Though their
    management ended with Jeannie's stroke two years ago, they still are
    serving as volunteers for Sports Day Hank and Jeannie haven't just loved on other homeschoolers, for
  over 20 years they have been passionate about loving anyone,
  especially those that are broken and hurting. They have a GOD FAMILY
  of over 70 people that have been ""added-on"" to their family
  as God Daughters, God Sons, and God Grandkids. Their GOD FAMILY
  includes 11 nationalities, and two survivors of human trafficking that
  came through SAMARITANS TOUCH  ( http://samaritanstouch.com ) a
  ministry to survivors of human trafficking that Hank and Jeannie
  started in 2008. In December Hank had oral surgery that triggered Shingles. He has
  been in constant pain since then, but he biggest impact is that the
  shingles has had on him is that it has destroyed 50-70% of his
  hearing. When Hank was 5, he lost the hearing in his right ear to
  mumps, so he’s already deaf in that ear and losing his hearing in the
  other ear has been devastating. Obviously, Hank needs a hearing aid!
  The cost of the hearing aid is substantial and their insurance won’t
  cover it. The $5,500 target is sufficient to cover the needed hearing aid, and
  an additional oral surgery he needs. Any additional support will go to
  pain therapy, lost wages, and cover the costs of buying a new cell
  phone. The hearing aids won't work with an Android phone, so Hank will
  need to pay off his current phone and buy a new iPhone. They are also
  hoping to get away for some refreshing and renewal time. Ever since
  Jeannie's stroke two years ago, stress overwhelms her and Hank's
  Shingles has definitely overwhelmed her. *Any money donated will go
  directly into Hank's PayPal account. Hank & Jeannie Tate have blessed the lives of homeschoolers in
  incredible ways, even thousands that have never met them. I have
  watched them bless others for many years. Please consider blessing

100,Help me get Enchroma glasses for my 8 year old son <3,U.S. Dollar,369,4,27%,"Hello, my name is Melissa. I am the
    mother of 6 wonderful children. My husband and I manage a campground
    in Colorado. While we are originally from Iowa, my husband was born
    in Colorado and we recently moved back here to be closer to his
    dad.  We have lived here for two years and love it here in Colorful Colorado! To begin my story,  lets go back to when my husband and I lived in
    Iowa. We had 3 children at the time, and were pregnant with our
    fourth.  We worked our 6-3 jobs and took the kids to daycare early.
    It was routine for a really long time. Brayden changed all that. 
    Brayden was due to be born 10/10/10. However, he decided that was
    too far out to wait any longer, and was instead he entered our world
    on July 29, 2010. He weighed in at 3 lbs 5 oz and was 15 1/2 inches
    long. We spent 6 weeks in the NICU in Iowa City, which was
    approximately 1 and 1/2 hours from our home. My husband and I
    traveled to see him nearly every day, only missing 6 days out of the
    total time Brayden spent there. We were blessed to have family back
    home to help us with our other 3 children who were just getting
    ready to go back to school from summer break. He soon was able to transfer to a local hospital where he spent 3
    more weeks before being able to finally come home, one week before
    his initial due date. He came home on oxygen and so I spent six more
    weeks toting around an oxygen tank anywhere we had to go.  Brayden
    went to occupational therapy and continued to receive additional
    assistance throughout his early school years. I am happy to report
    Brayden has recently achieved all milestones and is now on an equal
    playing field as all other kids his age! Brayden has always worn glasses from a pretty young age, but it was
    only at a recent eye exam that I learned that he is moderately
    red-green color blind. Wow, what an eye opener! Now thinking back,
    it may explain some things. I have more than once seem him trip over
    the same object on the floor. An object similar in color to the
    floor itself. But perhaps more importantly would be his often times
    pouty and dismal attitude...how boring the world must be without
    certain colors! I recently have learned about Enchroma eye glasses. I have watched
    the videos and now imagine the day I can get Brayden a pair. Of
    course the price tag is not cheap, as with anything worthwhile.
    Especially considering he would need prescription glasses on top of
    it.  With 6 children to raise, it seems pretty far away before I can
    fit these in our budget.  I have seen what crowdfunding can do and
    so hey...I am coming to my family, friends and fellow members of
    society.. Can you help me out?? I would love to be able to give my
    son the gift of color!  Living here in Colorful Colorado, it would
    be an astonishing gift! His birthday is coming up! I appreciate you

  severity of which has left him with anoxic brain injury (this is

  complete unknown aspect of what lies ahead in terms of recovery is
  what is being faced at this time. Jasper has weathered the
  'neurological storms' that came upon him as a result of this injury.
  These were very severe and difficult to bear. Doctors stated that

1670,Please Help Us With Dad's Pancreatic Cancer Chemo Costs,Euro,37 000,47,5%,"A few weeks ago, my father, Florin, was diagnosed with stage 3
  pancreatic cancer at the head of the pancreas. For those who don’t
  know us, I’m Laura, I have a sister and a brother who’s 11 years old,
  so still only a young kid who doesn’t fully understand what is
  happening with our father’s health. We are all desperate and worried
  and have started this fundraising campaign to ask for your help and
  kindness, to be able to cover our father’s chemo treatment costs. We
  can’t even imagine living in a world where our father is no longer
  there and even writing this down makes my hands shake. For us all, this terrible news has come as a shock, we couldn’t
  believe something like this could happen to him. I saw him first on
  the 13th of February after my last visit home in October, and I felt a
  knot in my throat. He had just had a stent inserted to help with the
  jaundice and the tall, imposing, well build man I’ve always known him
  to be was then skinny and grey skinned. Since then, he’s looking much
  better, gained back a healthier color in his cheeks, he’s got a
  healthy appetite and he’s feeling hopeful and determined to get better. At the moment, the tumor they found is a huge 45 millimeters
  adenocarcinoma and is not operable. Thankfully, a chemo treatment
  available in Vienna could improve his life chances, hopefully
  shrinking the tumor down, making it operable. Last week, doctors
  advised treatment should start immediately as there is no more time to
  waste and the healthcare standard available in Vienna is the best
  available option for my dad’s prognosis. On the 1st of March, he
  started his first round of chemo with Abraxane and Gemzar. Each chemo
  session is charged at 3700 euros and the cost is estimated at around
  37.000 euros for the first few months of treatment. Right now, we’re
  taking it step by step, though in the near future, under the
  circumstances, we do not know how we will be able to afford treatment
  anymore. It’ s widely known that pancreatic cancer is one of the most
  aggressive types, but if anyone can come back from this, I know it’s
  our dad. He has always been a strong, optimistic man and continues to
  be so even under the circumstances. He is willing to do and try
  everything possible to fight this, but we do need help to see him
  through. Please, as far as possible, help us get there! Any donations
  can help us get closer to saving dad. We will forever be thankful and
  grateful for your kindness! .......................................................................................................................... Cu câteva săptămâni în urmă, tatal nostru, Florin Mateescu, a fost
  diagnosticat cu cancer pancreatic, stadiul 3 la cap de pancreas.
  Pentru cei ce nu ne cunosc, sunt Laura, am o soră și un frate care are
  11 ani,  încă un copil, care nu înțelege pe deplin ce se întâmplă cu
  sănătatea tatălui nostru. Suntem cu toții disperați și îngrijorați și
  am început această campanie de strângere de fonduri pentru a cere
  ajutorul vostru și a face apel bunătatii voastre, sa putem acoperi
  costurile de tratament pentru tata. Nici nu ne putem închipui să trăim
  într-o lume în care el nu mai este și numai scriind aceste randuri,
  imi tremura mainile. Pentru noi toți, această veste teribilă a venit ca un șoc, nici acum
  nu putem crede că așa ceva i se putea întâmpla lui. Pe 13 Februarie,
  prima dată când l-am văzut pe tata de la ultima mea vizită in Romania
  din Octombrie, am simțit un nod în gât. Tocmai ce ii pusesera un stent
  pentru a controla icterul, arata slab, cu pielea de o culoare cenusie.
  De atunci, se simte mult mai bine, are din nou o culoare sănătoasă în
  obraji, un apetit sănătos și se simte plin de speranță și hotărât să
  faca tot posibilul sa se insanatoseasca. Tumoarea pe care au descoperit-o este un adenocarcinom de 45 de
  milimetri și care, deocamdata nu este operabil. Din fericire, un
  tratament cu chimioterapie disponibil în Viena ar putea să-i
  îmbunătățească șansele de viață, sperând că o sa scadă tumoarea,
  devenind operabila. Săptămâna trecută, medicii au recomandat ca
  tratamentul să înceapă imediat, nu mai este timp de pierdut, iar
  standardul medical disponibil în Viena este cea mai bună opțiune
  disponibilă pentru tratarea tatălui meu. La 1 Martie, a început prima
  rundă de chimioterapie cu Abraxane și Gemzar. Fiecare sesiune de
  chimioterapie costa 3700 de euro, iar costul este estimat la
  aproximativ 37.000 de euro pentru primele luni de tratament. In
  momentul de fata, o luăm pas cu pas, deși în viitorul apropiat, în
  aceste circumstanțe, nu știm cum vom putea să ne permitem continuarea tratamentului. Dupa cum se bine stie, cancerul pancreatic este unul din tipurile
  cele mai agresive, dar dacă cineva poate reusi in lupta asta, știu că
  acea persoana e tată. El a fost întotdeauna un om puternic, optimist
  și continuă să fie la fel chiar si în aceste momente. Este dispus să
  facă și să încerce tot posibilul pentru a lupta împotriva acestui
  cancer, dar avem nevoie de sprijinul vostru. Vă rugăm, pe cat posibil,
  să ne ajutati, orice donație ne poate aduce mai aproape de a il salva
  pe tata. Va vom fi pentru totdeauna recunoscători pentru bunătatea voastră!",https://fundrazr.com/c1TAWc

      He is color blind. He has strong proton color blindness. This
      means that his red cones don't detect enough red and are too
      sensitive to greens, yellows and organs. As a result, greens,
      yellows, oranges, reds and browns appear the same especially in
      low light. He also has difficulty telling blues from purples and
      pinks from grays. Jaxson is a sweet kid and is well adapted to having color blindness

    granted how much you rely on seeing color. There are many common
    things that Jaxson struggles with: picking out clothes that match,
    finding the right color of LEGO while building a kit, seeing print
    on a colored background, and even seeing his bobber while fishing. I took him to try the color blind glasses out because he told me
    that he just wanted to see what the world was really like. He
    described seeing colors for the first times as amazing and
    mind-blowing! He told me that he saw colors that he never saw before
    like red, purple and pink. He told me that he doesn't want me to get him the glasses because

    that much money on him. I would like to get him these for his
    birthday so that he doesn't feel as if we are spending tons of money

    Professional Training in Berlin Welcome to my fundraising campaign. I need your help to pay for my six months training at the Institute
  of Somatic Sexology to become a somatic sex educator. http://sexological-bodywork.institute/ Who am I? I am questioning things. I am curious, I am aware of the fact
  that there is more then one truth, more then one way of living a life. My eating disorders brought me into studying nutrition, and
  afterwards into becoming a chef in order to confront and step by step
  to heal myself. Miscommunication and a lack of loving touch in my
  family also took me on this journey. My trauma was drawing important
  steps in my life so far. Now, I developed a understanding that working with my wound/
  with my trauma is a life long journey. I see the importance of working
  with and raising life energy. Our strongest life energy is our sexual
  energy. Within every journey has to travel through sexuality. I feel I
  need to support and heal other beings, especially women. I am able to
  meet them where they are. I understand, because I am travelling the
  same journey. In my opinion there is a connection in between our eating and
  sexual behaviour, I would like to learn and to research deeper
  regarding this interaction. What is a sexual somatic bodyworker? A Certified Sexological Bodyworker educates and empowers people
  who are interested in their own erotic development. By using breath,
  voice, movement, touch and massage, a professional sexual bodyworker
  is providing a journey for people to find out more about their bodies,
  sex and sexuality, or work through sexual issues or concerns. My goals with the course: • Being able to create and hold a safe space for people who are
  on their journey of experiencing themselves by travelling through

1832,Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,U.S. Dollar,500 000,26,0%,"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.",https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1
160,Please help fund Emma's SRS surgery,Australian Dollar,30 000,5,1%,"I'm a male-to-female (MtF) transgender female. 23 years old. I'm first and foremost human who deserves happiness, like we all do :) Please help me in achieving a life awaited dream of mine. I've been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for nearly two years
  now. Had a bilateral Orchiectomy in August 2014. Although I've been
  transitioning ever since I was 19 with the knowledge Iam transgender
  from a very young age. Since 2011 till present;  I have undergone more
  than just physical and emotional changes.  I had/have to attend
  numerous physiologist,  psychiatrist, endocrinologist, GP and many
  other specialist appointments, tests/examinations and blood tests.
  Along the side had and continue to put up with the financial and
  emotional stress, and burden from society and my family. I moved out to be independent in May 2014.  Since then more drama had
  developed.  Adding to the financial pain. All my appointments, tests,
  medicine and travel is very costly and adds to the hole in my pocket.
   Day after day i deal with a lot, just to get by without going crazy.
   I have lost a job over who i am and been refused many since then.
  Being transgender isn't easy, but it's who I am and I will do anything
  in my power to be a full female; or die trying.  Unfortunately the
  Australian Government doesn't cover my surgery.  I need this surgery
  to live.  In order to function and enjoy being a full female,  SRS is
  mentally,  physically and emotionally necessary. If you could help
  make this dream, a reality that would be the most appropriated. Love cooking, baking, fashion, sewing, travel, animals, movies,
  music, winter, tea and health. Thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/dwIO5
4985,Please Help Us Support Bob's Recovery,Canadian Dollar,25000,26,20%,"HELP BOB GET HIS PROSTHETIC LEG, GET OUTDOOR WHEELS AND MOVE
    TO A WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE APARTMENT We have collectively started this fundraiser for Bob; our Dad,
    Grandpa, Cousin, Partner and Friend who is living with diabetes and
    is now facing his third amputation. Over the past 6 years, Bob’s health has declined dramatically
    going from managing through diet to PD at home 24/7, to in and out
    of ER, being admitted on and off to his recent amputations. The disease is currently expressing itself with acute renal,
    liver failure, high blood pressure and debilitating vascular
    cognitive as well as peripheral artery disease. In November 2018 Bob
    endured two amputations, first a toe which didn’t heal then soon
    afterwards, the below the knee amputation. Bob is now facing the amputation of his other leg which will
    cause us to have to move again. The Fundrazr funds will be managed in a trust. For all the details
  about Bob's budget and health challenges please scroll to the end. Read on for Bob's story and letters from our family... Please help us help Bob . In the next 1- 6 months, he’s facing new costs for a Prosthetic
    leg, outdoor electric wheelchair (his current one is ok indoors but
    can’t go up a hill or keep up with someone walking slowly), a move
    to a wheelchair accessible apartment, payments on a van with a lift
    and the ever increasing list of medications that are not covered.
    We’re posting the details of upcoming expenses below. All
    contributions will be going into a trust managed by our friend and
    lawyer - Amanda Rose. We’ll be posting photos and Amanda will be
    posting updates on how the funds are used. Bob is still hopeful to
    eventually recover from current challenges in order to meet the
    requirements to undergo the kidney transplant. The costs and debt have been piling up and it’s overwhelming.
    Bob's close circle of family has been helping and his partner Fitu
    is working 3 side jobs plus her F/T position as a site resident
    manager, allowing her to care for Bob at home. Until now, we’ve all
    been pretty quiet about this but it’s just not possible anymore. Any help you can offer will be a
    huge help - whether it’s making a donation of any size, commenting
    below, sharing Bob’s story in person, on the phone, in email or
    social media. Let’s get Bob’s story to everyone who knows him on the
    BC coast and beyond. BOB’S STORY Those of you who are lucky enough to share in Bob’s life, you
    know it’s an adventurous one. Fisherman, Father, Friend. Family. Bob
    was born on February 2nd, 1956 and grew up in Burnaby while he spent
    his summers fishing in Alert Bay. As a kid, Bob was fortunate to be invited aboard to join the
    crew on the Cape Cook by Gilbert Cook Sr.. Eventually young Gilbert
    took over and he stayed for a few seasons. Bob also crewed salmon on
    the Jean W., Bruce Luck, Good Partner and the Sleep Robber. He also
    fished herring on the Jean W, Dawn Treader and Waverley. Bob says,
    “I ran the Sea Castle and a few other gillnetters. I can’t recall
    the names but that is just where my brain is going…” Whether on land or water, Bobby is a hard worker. He takes
    utmost pride in caring for his family, his children and
    grandchildren: the loves of his life.  He’s the Bob of all trades,
    and well, master of them, too. While on land Bob is a painter and a
    carpenter and has done repairs, maintenance and renovations from his
    own apartments to large condo complexes. He’s known for his
    attention to meticulous detail...everything must be totally squared off! While on the water, Bob is in his element. Happy, working hard,
    visiting and laughing with people on other boats,  telling stories
    and fooling everyone with his jokes - always delivered as true
    stories with a straight face! FITU & BOB  - OUR CONNECTION Mine and Bob’s long history began with our grandparents.  Our
    grandfathers were seine fisherman from Alert Bay. Our grandmothers
    were best friends who raised their children together in a small town
    and later moved to Vancouver as their families grew in numbers and
    age so they could attend school in the city. Our mothers remained friends throughout their lives and raised
    their children together. Bob and I grew up together, always friends.
    We both went our separate ways, married others and raised our
    children only seeing each other at various family events or during
    the fishing seasons. In 2009, both single, our paths met again; this
    time we brought with us our huge mixed bag of beautiful children.
    Now after 11 years, our family includes grandchildren from our kids
    and our closest friends. As you can see in the photos, the kids are
    Bob’s joy and they feel the same way. Dad, love you from Courtney – Honestly, I am not
  really sure where to start. Not a single day passes by that I don’t
  think of you, even though I don’t see you as often as I would like.
  Bey, Maddox, Laila and I miss you daily and wish we lived closer so we
  could spend more time with you. You have always been the “rock” in my
  life and I just want you to know that if I lived closer, I would
  strive to be the “rock” in yours. You entered my life when I was a baby and even though I was not
  biologically your child, you always treated me as though I was. You
  raised me as though I was your own and I never questioned that I
  wasn’t (besides wondering why my hair was dark and Britt’s and Nick’s
  was blond LOL). Even when I learned that you weren’t my biological
  father, I never felt that you were anything other than my dad. YOU
  were the one who helped teach me to walk, talk, ride a bike, drive,
  etc. Through every milestone in my life, YOU were there. YOU were my rock. Some of my best memories are the times we spent on the fishing
  boat. Bringing in the nets, playing with sea creatures, scrubbing the
  decks and beautiful sunsets taught me more about life then you will
  ever know. Seeing killer whales so close to the boat we could touch
  them was such an amazing experience that has remained in my mind all
  these years. Although the large storms and trying to find other boats
  to tie up to were scary as a child, you always made us feel secure and
  safe. I wouldn’t trade these memories in for the world. I know my teenage years were not easy for anyone, but you
  handled them like a champ. I was a terrible teenager, but you NEVER
  treated me as such. The nights of me failing to come home, my
  dishonesty, and the many bad decisions I made never changed the way
  you treated me or felt about me. One of your best attributes is that
  you NEVER judge people. Many times during this rough time in my life I
  felt judged by people but never by you. No matter what I did or didn’t
  do you were always there. I remember the many times you came to find
  me and when you did, there were no questions asked. No judgement. No
  yelling. You accepted me as I was and never pushed me away. I could
  tell you anything without fear of judgement or being in trouble. I
  want you to know that without your support during this time, I am not
  sure that the outcome would ended up as good as it did. Again, you
  were always my rock. It is because of your support that I am
  where I am today – happily married with 2 wonderful kids. Bey
  considers you as a father and has the utmost respect for you. Maddox
  and Laila ask about grandpa all the time. They always ask how grandpa
  is doing and when he will come down to visit next. Maddox especially
  understands what grandpa is going through and is so empathetic and
  helpful it amazes me. We all understand this time in your life has taken a physical
  and emotional toll on you. Like you always told me “life isn’t easy”.
  You have so much support and love that if we all work together, we can
  help make your “new” life as easy and enjoyable as possible for you. I want to say thank you to Fitu. I know this has also been
  physically and emotionally hard on you as well. Dad is extremely lucky
  to have you in his life. The amount of time you dedicate towards dads
  care is incredible and you do it all without any complaint. I know you
  are his “rock”. You are one of the most selfless people I know and
  from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate everything you have done and
  continue to do for my dad. My rock. For Dad, love Brit - I often reflect on the
  continuous presence you have in my life – the days, weeks and years
  through which your duty as my father has brought nothing but pure
  enjoyment. You are a support of strength, encouragement and
  discipline. Your love is endless - you are a man to be admired. From a young age, I can remember the many hours you spent
  playing with me, the thousands of kisses goodnight and the countless
  trips out for meals when dinner on the table was “questionable”. I
  recognize the moments for which you were and are there – no matter the
  sacrifice. You give me all the love, time, care and appreciation that
  you have available. I am grateful for the countless phone calls and
  advice given when I have no one else to turn to. As though it was yesterday, I remember you gifting me my first
  car and shortly after that helping me shop for the car of my dreams.
  Truth be told, I had no idea what the process entailed and was a
  little overwhelmed in the moment, but as with every other milestone in
  my life you held my hand and walked me through it all. By the end of
  the day, I had a car of my own and the freedom to take me where I
  needed to go. That freedom took me to university, where you continued to
  provide your infinite support of home cooked meals and a roof over my
  head, albeit not always with walls. The day I graduated your sported a
  look of “honored father”, one that boasted how proud you were of me
  and shouted to the world that you had all the confidence and trust in
  it to guide me through to the next journey in my life. Not many years after that, you waited (not so) patiently outside
  of my delivery room where you were blessed with one of the most kind,
  loving and caring little boys you will ever have the pleasure of
  knowing. I knew right away that the bond between you two would be
  special and that your firm and gentle touch was as loving as could be.
  Again, those tears in your eyes told me just how proud you were of me
  in that particular moment in time. From there we traveled to Los Cabos where you met me in my suite
  to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. Neither one of us knew
  what to do, how slowly we should walk, where we should look or how to
  link arms, and just like that the moment flew by. We got to the
  gazebo, you blinked back tears and you couldn’t say a word. The
  message was clear – you were proud. Each of the milestones mentioned above, along with many more
  occurred as I transitioned from a child to an adult. Each symbolized a
  moment when I needed to be guided in order to grow. Your loyalty,
  confidence and unconditional support has moved mountains in my life,
  and there are still mountains left to move, so don’t think for a
  second that your job is done! I need you in the years ahead, and to
  play your role with fineness. I need you more than ever. I often reflect on the continuous presence you have in my life –
  the days, weeks and years through which your duty as my father has
  brought nothing but pure enjoyment. You are a support of strength,
  encouragement and discipline. Your love is endless - you are a man to
  be admired. From Jojo Our Creature As Carson’s’ nanny, I serendipitously, etc. etc. etc. met Bobby
  April 2016. I was the last to know there was an existing established
  relationship between my “ward” and Bobby and Fitu. Why are these
  people cooing over my sweetie pie in the elevator? How do they know
  his name? Why is my sweetie pie responding so lovingly to these
  strangers? Thank you, Bobby for… (loving Little as his own / loving me
  as his own.) One random Tuesday, this familiar stranger Bobby invited me and
  my sweetie pie to spend the day at the beach, which happen to turn out
  to be the first of many. I am Jody, but I happily spent many warm, sunny beautiful days
  as “Brittany” while our sweetie pie vacillated between being Carson in
  flesh and nostalgically baby Linden. Other times our sweetie pie was
  Baby Nick, other days he was Maddox. Some days I was Courtney. We sure
  had to keep an eye on curious Baby Wayne! I hadn’t yet met Bobby’s
  children, but I felt a comfortable closeness to each of them. I knew
  and felt Carson and I were safe and loved with this familiar
  stranger…the three of us journeying through time and space Jody and
  Carson, and Wayne and Courtney and Brittany and Nick and Skye and
  Maddox and Laila and Linden loved up and safely kept by Bobby, their
  Father, their Grandpa…this familiar stranger, my friend. As Summer turned to Fall things got real: Bobbly learned
  feminism and Jody learned to bite her tongue. Let’s face it, social
  graces between Bobby and I fell quicker and more plentiful than the
  autumn leaves. I gifted Bobby with the privilege of gender politics
  and all that is Feminism. I was gifted in return with the ins and outs
  of Republicans. Poor Fitu had to share her own living room with Fox
  News and Bobby and Jody and our thoughts Hawkins cheesies and our
  opinions and for some reason I don’t think either Bobby or I kept
  things to a dull roar. From Deb - Meeting you “My Bob” (as my kids call you
  ) 6 years ago , we would never have imagined what a great influence
  you would have on our life. All the time you spent with my girls especially Iylah who came
  out of her shyness so quickly with you and Fitu, coming over when our
  sink flooded in the middle of the night , helping me scrape paint off
  my window sills due to my lousy painting ability, bbqing us chicken
  burgers, being my go to guy when it came to a lot of things and so on.
  You will never know how much I appreciate everything you’ve done for
  us. You are a perfect example of a wonderful Grandpa , Dad and
  friend is and we are lucky to call you family. Our love for you
  is immense and we adore and support you always! Deb From Amaya - I don’t even know where do begin. You
  are awesome all around I wanna say thank you for everything you’ve
  done for me, my mom, and my sisters. I know it may seem I don’t
  acknowledge anymore lol but know I love you and appreciate everything
  you’ve done for us From Zaida - My Bob there are no words that describe
  how much I love you. You have always been there for me like a dad and
  I can’t thank you enough. Thank you for all the chicken burgers,
  wheelchair rides, babysitting, and so much more. Know that I am always
  here for you cause you were always there for me. Love you. From Iylah - My Bob. I love you so much you were the
  best babysitter ever I miss seeing you every day and cuddling in the
  lobby with you. You always make me laugh and I wish I didn’t
  have to go to school so I could hang out with you more Thank you
  for always being there for me love you Thank you for reading, caring,
    helping, sharing and being part of Bob’s story! We also want to say
    that although we’re facing another crisis, we’re grateful for all
    the love and support - time and money - so far. As can be well imagined, Bob’s life has made dramatic shift. We
    are so proud of all our children, grandchildren, friends and family
    who have joined us in this ever changing journey, it has certainly
    been challenging and enlightening. We’re very grateful to our huge
    mixed bag of kids, brothers Kevin and Doug, their wives Carolyn and
    Sue, Aunt Carol, Uncle David,  Aunt Marni and Uncle John as well as
    friends that were available to visit, offering their loving support
    both emotionally and financially. The grandkids have especially been awesome! They’ve displayed
    loving curiosity while being very patient, never, ok rarely whining,
    complaining or acting out. Love you all tons and we are so blessed
    to have you all Skylar, Maddox, Linden, Mikhail, Giaan, Carson and
    our beautiful Laila.  To the eldest; Sky you display such absolute
    amazing character for a 16 yr old young man, how you help, play and
    patiently care for the young ones. Mikhail, your FaceTime and
    pictures from the other side of the world are heartwarmingly
    precious, we are grateful. All of the parents have done a fabulous
    job helping the ‘lil ones navigate this difficult time…. you have
    all done well considering the situation. The grandones don’t fully
    understand what’s happening although for the youngest ones, it’s the norm. I am especially grateful to my assistant/friend Deb for her
    constant reliability and devotion, and to her 3 amazing girls, who
    all refer to Bob as “their Bob”. Deb has been instrumental in
    allowing me to devote so much of my time to being there for Bob. DLL, as always thank you for your ear, heart and brilliant mind.
    Your calm, quiet presence and the solid support is a precious gift.
     Tom, thank you as well. BNG, thank you for always checking in and being there no matter
    how crazy busy you are. The unconditional love, goofy antics and
    support along with your generosity means everything. AJR, as always, eternally grateful for you, your kind heart,
    sharp legal mind, meals left outside the door, beautiful time
    consuming and thoughtfully created gifts. I also would like to especially thank who we lovingly and
    jokingly refer to as our 42-year-old teenager Jojo.  She constantly
    makes herself available to be with Bob if I’m not. She regularly
    does grocery runs and has become our garbage fairy (as she leaves
    she will grab our garbage hauling it to garbage room). Jojo will sit
    in his room visiting, easily chatting or in silence often doing her
    crafts as he rests, watches TV or sleeps.  Her gentle, loving,
    subdued inconspicuous concern and charming ways make his days pass
    easier. Sandy, your exquisitely blended oils created with love, prayers
    and healthy blessings continue to benefit Bob, thank you. I must also acknowledge the boys;  for hauling furniture around
    up and down the building organizing our condo to accommodate Bob’s
    wheel chair, medical equipment and years of packing boxes of
    dialysis solution, picking up the slack in all the lil constant
    things Bob used to do for me at work.  Grateful they all live so
    close by, able to help whenever I call or just randomly drop by. And
    to our Spring/Summer imported one, Leo you are always willing to
    help with a huge grin, thank you. A huge thank you to Courtney and Bey for gifting the indoor
    electric wheelchair, it’s made your Dad’s life so much easier.
     Although you both are very busy with careers and kids you make
    certain to keep in touch. Bey, we are forever grateful for the care,
    love and support you constantly demonstrate to us, especially Dad. Wayne, Jr., Gibran and Ale, you have been very generous with
    your loving support, time  and financial assistance these last
    years, we are grateful. To Brit, your regular upbeat and positive cheerful calls are
    heartwarming, we acknowledge that these last years have been
    extremely difficult for you. Adam we are grateful for your support
    and care in all that you do, especially the late night delivery of
    oxygen tanks. To both Dan and Bryan, thank you for sitting with him regularly
    while in the hospital giving me a break and allowing me to run home
    for a shower.  Bryan, Dan, Edgar and Jack you continue to be there,
    still making the effort to take Bob out getting together for a meal. WHY FUNDRAZR - DETAILS ON WHY BOB NEEDS HELP Bob receives CPP Disability of $1032 monthly. Together with
    Fitu’s income, there is a backwards slide every month and credit has
    been maxed out for a while. Our family Fundrazr campaign is to cover the areas listed
    below. Please consider donating; all funds raised will be held in a
    Trust Account set up by a lawyer who’s generously offering her time.
    All funds will be allocated towards Bob’s medical expenses, recovery
    and transitions to begin living his “new normal” life.  Any extra
    funds will be used for getting him some part time assistance as Fitu
    is working F/T and can’t always be with him. PROSTHETIC LEG - $4,000-$5,000 (balance of $10,000
    paid by Medical) Bob’s right foot and leg to the knee have already been
    amputated. Prosthetic leg costs are only partially covered. At this
    time, funds will only be used for the prosthetic for his right leg.
    We’re still in the process and will update when we know the exact
    amount that we’ll need. Fingers crossed that Bob will once again be
    able to golf, get out on the water again and work around the
    apartment tower. OUTDOOR ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIR - $5500 Bob will require an outdoor electric wheelchair. The one he has
    right now is very low power and not designed to go outside. It can’t
    make it up even a slight incline. Bob will have a lot more mobility
    and be able to get out and about, go grocery shopping and enjoy the
    spring with the grandkids. MOVING TO A WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY APARTMENT - $2400 (Moving Expenses $1200 + Rent Increase $200x 6/mo = $1200). The suite we currently live in is not wheelchair friendly and
    Bob has extreme difficulty moving about. The doorways are very
    narrow, he’s unable to ride into bathroom as the door opens in, so
    he must leave it in the hallway and hop into the bathroom, so far
    he’s fallen three times trying to negotiate his way in. Our kitchen
    is difficult for Bob to use, whereas the new one will only have one
    long bank of cabinets and appliances, not a “U” shape. Bob has always been a great cook and the new kitchen will make
    it possible for him to make food safely. We will be moving two buildings away to the 4th tower.  We are
    limited as to where we can live because of my work as an onsite
    resident managing the building.  The same developer will have an
    accessible friendly suite ready for us. We will incur moving
    expenses along with a $200 monthly rent increase to what we
    currently pay but with the prognosis of extended rehab and the
    likelihood of another amputation we don’t have much of a choice. MEDICATION - $1100 x 6/ mo = $6600 Bob’s dialysis solution are covered by BC Medical. However, we
    pay cash for the diabetes and blood pressure medication. A new cost
    since March is Bob’s Chinese herbal medicines which are specifically
    for circulation for the leg. He’s noticed an improvement and the
    medicines will help keep the remaining leg and arms healthy so Bob
    can continue to live life to the fullest and do the things he loves
    like cooking for the family and playing with the kids. VAN THAT CAN TRANSPORT THE WHEELCHAIR  - $4320 Bob is in and out of the hospital. Plus there are a ton of
    doctors appointments. In November, we purchased a new van to
    transport Bob, wheelchair and dialysis equipment and supplies.
    Payments are $720/ month. $4320 of raised funds will cover 6 months
    and take a bit of financial pressure off. The journey to help Bob stabilize and live many more years
      is ongoing and we’re grateful to all of our family and friends
      who’ve been there and continue to be. BOB'S MEDICAL HISTORY 2012  July - Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and
    high blood pressure.  At this point all was blood work and symptoms were an indication that Bob was hopeful
    to control the symptoms with diet and medicine. 2013 Diabetes controlled with medications and diet adjustments as was
    blood pressure. Losing sensation in feet due to diabetic neuropathy, onset of
    almost constant nausea accompanied by lack of energy.  Back then I began rating his
    overall well-being as 3-4 good days followed by 1 bad day. 2014 Diagnosed with the beginning stages of kidney failure, altered
    diet yet again, this was a struggle to balance a diabetic friendly diet with the renal
    failure diet. i.e. nuts and cheese recommended for diabetics are not permitted for renal patients. 2015 Followed by his nephrologist, Kidney Clinic and
  several other health professionals - opthamologist,
    cardiologist, internal medicine, vascular surgeon etc. 2016 March Began daily Peritoneal Dialysis , 6
    cycles/exchanges per day.  Improved energy with blood work reflecting stabilizing symptoms with treatment. 2017 Peritoneal Dialysis treatment was causing other issues with
    peritoneal cavity and organs. Diagnosed with hernias caused by PD and the weight of
    2000 ml of solution constantly putting pressure on lining and supporting muscles. Oct - Began the process for preparing for a kidney
    transplant, unfortunately there were ongoing complications and
    increasing health issues compromising the viability of a transplant.
     As quickly as our medical system permitted we began addressing each
    concern only to constantly find another. The diabetes, although well
    controlled, was slowly and quietly but effectively destroying his
    eyes, weakening other organs, affecting the mind and circulation.
    Renal failure causes the destruction of soft muscle tissue, heart,
    liver, lungs etc. Liver function tests were showing that the enzymes
    are unhealthy, showing that there were cysts, scar tissue and the
    beginning of cirrhosis. Bob was told that he’ll eventually require a liver transplant as
    well but it should not interfere with a kidney transplant.  His
    heart has 50% blockage in the upper apex the surgeon will wait to
    insert stents when it is at 70% and appears to be fine aside from
    the high blood pressure. Since 2016 Bob has been closely followed by an Opthamologist,
    monthly he would see her, for scans, injections and laser treatments
    to increase eye health and vision.  She was successful, Bob’s vision
    is actually pretty good. The prognosis is also positive as for some
    time he was very fearful and worried that he’d be blind as well. Another prerequisite for Bob’s health to remain on the
    transplant list is that all of his dental work must be certified by
    a dentist so as not be a risk for future infection, advised that the
    most effective and absolute way to ensure that would be to have his
    remaining teeth extracted and be fitted for dentures. Fortunately
    with the financial help from Kevin and Carolyn, Bob was able to have
    this done in November 2018. One more step towards transplant, or as
    Bob would say, ""one hop at a time"" . 2018 Jan - at this point the side effects of peritoneal
    dialysis were debilitating and Bob remained bed ridden most of the times. Constant nausea and
    vomiting for 5 months requiring weekly trips to emergency for IVs to
    increase fluid in body, extreme weight and muscle mass loss. June - Hemodialysis treatment alleviated the nausea
    and seemed to overall increase Bob’s energy. July - Final stages of extensive transplant testing
    the Kidney Transplant team has determined that although I am a
    match, because Bob has received transfusions he now has antibodies
    that will not accept my kidney.  We are now included in a program
    called “Paired Donors” - this program matches a recipient and a
    donor with another set of participants across Canada, exchanging the
    available donor kidney. Aug - Tiny cut on right fourth toe eventually
    presented signs of gangrene, rounds of antibiotics were unsuccessful to cure infection. As the weeks
    and months passed without sufficient circulation to support the healing the entire toe was
    affected. Sept - During the 3 times weekly in hospital
    treatments of hemodialysis Bob regularly contracted infections and suffered with horrible stomach issues. At this point he chose to give PD another try.  Once he switched
    back to daily home administered peritoneal dialysis, stomach issues
    and infections no longer an issue.  Prognosis was to Insert stents
    to hopefully facilitate healing or at the very least to assist the
    healing of foot once toe was amputated. Oct 9 Admitted to RCH Angioplasty to insert stents in right leg to increase
    circulation to facilitate healing of toe October amputated toe Nov 6 amputated right leg below knee Now the rush is on to rearrange our condo, purchase all the
    required mobility equipment to begin our “new normal” lives. Nov 19 discharged from RCH - the healing process at
    home was slow but fortunately with being followed weekly by RCH’s
    awesome team at the Wound and Limb preservation clinic and his
    Vascular Surgeon Bob’s wound healed with only 2 infections. 2019 Left foot -  painful, extremely cold, no circulation discoloured
    red and no feeling in toes. Testing to determine blood flow and circulation - 50% of October
    2018 results March - amputation wound sufficiently healed to
    begin the process to be fitted for a prosthetic leg/foot which will
    cost $10-12,000.  On the wait list for rehab. March 4 - Chinese Dr. attended Bob at home to
    diagnose and try to help with lower leg and foot circulation to
    possibly save it from amputation.  Prescribed a twice daily dose of
    herbs. March 8 - Vascular Surgeon advises to wait and
    see, will eventually attempt to insert another stent as a last
    chance to postpone inevitable lower leg from amputation. March 23 - Wait list to begin training to perform
    home hemodialysis. April 2 - Continued positive results, less pain
    while continuing the Chinese Medicines. Thanks again for helping Bob!
    Please comment, spread the word and help him reach his Fundrazr
    goal, move to the new apartment and get his new leg. Everything
    helps and, Bob likes to say,  it's ""one hop at time!""",https://fundrazr.com/HelpSupportBob
100,"Can you hear that sound? Well, Amirul can’t. 
Help him hear again.",U.S. Dollar,75 000,5,1%,"During my childhood at the age of 7, while most children run around,
  have fun with their friends, joyfully shouting and playing. I
  lost my hearing on my left ear. I was told by my mother, during my infancy, I had a high fever which
  led to my loss of hearing. Because I was too young, it was hard for me to notice that I had lost
  one of my hearing. One night, my mother asked me to call my grandpa. I used my right ear
  to make the call. After making the call. I asked my mother. “Ma, how come people can use only one ear?” And she responded me “People use 2 ears dear.” She was surprised, that I asked such question, and asked me why I
  asked that question. And I told her, “I can hear with only one ear ma.” That’s when my mom first noticed that I couldn’t hear with my left
  ear, and I learned that God gave me two ears but can hear with only one. This was one of the heartbreaking times I had to go through, but I
  tried to stay positive and be thankful that I can hear with the other ear. Both my parents worked so hard to help me get hearing aids, but it
  wasn’t easy because it costed too much. It wasn’t easy for me but I
  bet it was more difficult for my parents because seeing me and taking
  few years to realize that I had this disability. Just like what every parent would do, my mother brought be to the doctor. The doctor recommended my mom to get me hearing aids. Because I was
  young, I didn’t know how this would affect my hearing later on. At
  first, I didn’t want to admit and get hearing aids because I didn’t
  want others to make fun of me at school, or how people would see me. Many years passed and I was attending college that time. It was during my 3rd semester in college. It was a normal day and I was attending class. I always had
  difficulty understanding the lessons because I couldn’t hear the
  lectures clearly from afar, so I thought I was just in a bad condition
  because my hearing was worse on that day. I went back and slept in early that day. On the next day, that
  was the day. That was the day I’ve completely lost my hearing. I thought everything was just quiet and I woke up to early. It
  wasn’t. I lost both of my hearing on that day. Only God knew what I felt that time. Most of my close friends knew that I have a hearing problem, but they
  didn’t knew that it was getting worse. Because, I had to continue my studies. I had to shrug everything off
  and continue attending class. It was very difficult for me, but my friends were there to comfort me
  and support me. Despite their support and comfort, I wanted to give up because I
  still had 2 semesters left, and it was all too overwhelming for me. I couldn’t hear anything the lecturer was talking about during class. In frustration, on that evening, I was alone in my room, and in the
  dark, I cried in the dark alone. I pushed everyone away from me because it was too hard for me to
  accept everything and place my friends in difficult situations, I
  didn’t want to make it hard for them. Few days have passed and it was getting more difficult for me, so I
  had to call my parents. I’m originally from Sibu but was studying in Kuching. I called them,
  but I couldn’t hear anything, I tried so hard to hear and raise the
  loudspeaker volume to the max. I could only hear little sounds but I knew my mom was crying, we all
  cried that night. My mom prayed really hard and tried to support me
  the best that she can. Seeing my mom working so hard to support me gave me the strength. I tried to think positive. During class, I wrote down all my
  notes by copying notes from my classmates. I read everyday and studied as much as I could. Imagine studying with both of your ear closed. It was one of the most
  hardest part of my life. I studied really hard and surprisingly passed all my courses for that semester. My mom worked really hard and saved up enough to get me basic hearing
  aid. Since the hearing aid was too expensive my mom could only afford
  to buy me one piece of hearing aid for my right ear. On my 4th semester, that’s when I started hearing again. Though it
  was only my right ear, I was so thankful that I could hear little by
  little again. I finished my associate degree and now I’m working as a contractual
  employee, I try hard to work but because of my hearing, It was hard
  for me to find a job and people to take me in. I went to the hospital to check my hearing progress and the doctor
  told me, my hearing has deteriorated and I need to get a better one,
  because we could only afford the basic hearing aid. I try to work as hard as I could for the present and for the future
  but sometimes, my efforts are not enough because capabilities are
  limits because of my hearing. My mother worked so hard to help me get this basic hearing aids, but
  our family is on a tight budget to pay off the dues, my sisters
  education fees and living expenses. This is my last hope, please help me hear again. The hearing aid’s costs 7500usd, but this is a huge amount of money
  for our family though we work hard, it would take us years to pay off
  this amount. This is my last wish. I want to hear again so, I can work better and
  support my family. Both my parents are old and still working to
  support us and pay off the dues. Your help would be highly appreciated no matter what amount it would be. Thank you for spending your precious time to read my story.",https://fundrazr.com/71UYk9
2585,MAY the 4TH  be with you Michael Bacon !,Canadian Dollar,55 000,25,47%,"APPEAL FROM SUZIE McNEIL It was in December that my good friend and manager Michael Bacon
  injured his right leg with partially torn quad tendons and his left
  leg with a small ankle fracture and a strained Achilles heel. With injuries to both of his legs simultaneously he was rendered
  unable to walk and admitted to Trillium Hospital on December 23 where
  he spent the Christmas holidays with close friends and family visiting. After spending over 28 days in the hospital for pain management,
  Michael was transferred to a long term care facility, commonly known
  as nursing homes, for Restorative Rehabilitation at the Cooksville
  Care Centre across the street from the hospital. Michael found it funny that his mother is 83 years old, has had a
  walker for years, had her knee replaced almost 2 years ago, both
  cataracts just operated on, and he beat her to a nursing home! Michael spent the last 3 months at the facility recovering and
  restoring his strength through ongoing daily physiotherapy.  He now
  can walk with the assistance of a walker and has just been released to
  return home to continue his recovery. I visited Michael at both the hospital and the nursing home and saw
  how difficult it was to see him confined to a hospital bed and only a
  wheelchair to get around for months, so seeing him walk with a walker
  is encouraging and I know he will fully recover. Unfortunately, being incapacitated for 4 months has put a toll on his
  finances as it would anyone not being able to work and having to put
  his business on hold.  On top of the loss of income is the expenses of
  the drugs, crutches, braces, boot cast, wheelchair, walkers, and
  ongoing physiotherapy which have added up considerably. As friends and family know Michael is always the first to offer his
  help when someone is in need, and has helped many musicians, friends
  and audiences enjoy live music together over the last 20 years in the
  music business. So to thank Michael for all of his hard work and generosity I decided
  to rally some support so I put together this FundRazr account and will
  host a fundraiser concert with many of the musicians Michael has
  worked with over the past 20 years.  Everyone was excited to be a part
  of it and we have an exceptional lineup of great musicians who are
  donating their time and talent to this great event. May the 4th be with you Michael Bacon! Featuring Suzie McNeil – Stacey Kay - Gord Deppe & Sandy Horne from
    the Spoons Jordan John – Tyler Yarema - Tom Barlow - Gracie Chuck Keeping – Peter Kadar and many more surprise guests! Saturday, May the 4th 4:00 -8:00 pm Shore Grill & Grotto 71 Lakeshore Rd E. Mississauga, ON It’s going to be one hell of a show and tickets are only $20 and will
  go fast so get them while you can. For advance sales, email the number of tickets required to maythe4thbewithyoumb@gmail.com For those who are unable to make it the fundraiser
  concert, we encourage you to contribute what you can to this
  FundRazr account to help make this event a great success and get
  Michael back on his own two feet again.",https://fundrazr.com/maythe4thbewithyoumb
140,Help Mel's Road to Recovery,U.S. Dollar,18000,3,1%,"My name is Melanie and THANK YOU for visiting my page! I am raising
  money to alleviate a portion of the financial stress that comes with
  having thousands of dollars worth of medical debt as a college student. In 2015, I was diagnosed with an eating disorder which has been with
  me since 2008. Eating disorders affect over 30 million people in the
  United States, and after a long period of denial, I recognize that I
  am one of those people, and that my life is at stake if I continue.
  Starting with the diagnosis in 2015, I have begun to seek recovery. Unfortunately, my first stay in residential treatment was not as
  effective as I'd hoped, in part because it was cut short due to
  financial stress and lack of adequate insurance coverage. Though there
  have been periods of decreased symptom-use while seeing an outpatient
  therapist, my health has continued to decline as symptoms have
  continued, especially with new stresses being introduced without the
  tools to manage depression and anxiety symptoms. This time around, things are vastly different. I've grown a lot, been able to keep a job as a Nurse's Aid where I
  love taking care of the elders and bonding with them. However, I've
  had to step away from that for the time being in order to give
  recovery a real chance, so that I can not only be out of the woods
  medically, but move on to the rest of my life as a healthy individual
  with a healthy relationship with others, starting with myself. As of Monday, June 10th, I will be admitted to Magnolia Creek's
  residential program just outside Birmingham, Alabama.  I know that I
  need this level of care to get myself to a healthy place, whatever the
  cost. However, it is not a cheap decision. Any help whether in prayers
  or in finances would be graciously received. I've been blessed with amazing, encouraging friends and coworkers as
  well as an adorable, faithful dog. If you would consider even giving a
  small contribution to this cause, my appreciation would be
  unfathomable, and you would quite literally be my hero. I thank you in
  advance for your kindness and generosity, and may God bless.",https://fundrazr.com/melsroadtorecovery
2986,Help Finley get on his feet,Pound Sterling,5000,138,60%,"Finley was born with cerebral palsy which is a life long condition
  which effects his muscles. Finley got cerebral palsy through lack of
  oxygen to his brain which has resulted in brain damage.  The simple
  things we take for granted Finley struggles with. Finley underwent an operation in Feb 2016 called selective dorsal
  rhizotomy. The surgeon cuts through the spine and cuts off some of the
  stems which are causing Finley's legs to be so stiff. This left him
  with loose legs which were so much easier to move but revealed the
  underlying muscle weakness. Finley is now 6 and able to walk with a
  walking frame although his main way of getting around is in his
  wheelchair or crawling around the house. Our ultimate goal is for
  Finley to be able to walk with sticks ! Finley gets 1 physio session a week on the NHS but he is required to
  do some sort of exercise everyday. He also has 1 swimming lesson a
  week. We have a private Physio who is £60 an hour who he sees once a
  week.  Finley is working so hard for her and as you can imagine it is
  to expensive for us to fund alone so we are kindly asking for people's
  help to get our little boy stronger All we want as parents is for Finley to live a healthy happy life and
  be able to keep up with his friends which ever way that may be. Thank you for everyone's support and donations it means so much to us

15744,Help Rich Reach the Finish Line,U.S. Dollar,25000,106,63%,"**Please note: Medical bills have already depleted the $12,369 that
  was raised over the past 4 years. ** In December of 2018, Rich learned that his Mantle Cell Lymphoma had
  returned. It was hard to receive this news before Christmas, but love
  for his family compelled him to continue his journey to being
  cancer-free. In January he began a 3 month treatment of Venetoclax,
  hoping the drug that worked so powerfully 2 years ago would bring him
  into remission again. Instead, his disease spread exponentially. While still mid-course in the Venetoclax treatment, we
  discovered that I, Rich’s sister, Janice, am a perfect 10/10 match for
  an allogenic stem cell transplant! A matched sibling donor is
  considered the “gold standard” for successful stem cell transplants.
  The answer to our prayers came at the perfect time! An allogenic stem
  cell transplant is the only potentially curative therapy for MCL On April 19, Rich began his 5th course of treatment in his 4 year
  cancer marathon. We are beyond thankful that he is now in remission
  and on track for an allogenic transplant at the end of June. After the
  transplant, Rich is not expected to be discharged back to his home

34780,Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,Canadian Dollar,40 000,182,87%,"Hello, We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage. Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support. Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block. In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software. Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits. In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    is considered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade. The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs. Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments. The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others. In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a
  link to additional photos. Please feel free to have a glimpse at the
  amazing life Victor has lived, and is living. We, Victor's friends and family, thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/fundvictor
31090,Urgent Support Needed for Tony Dowling's Cancer Journey!,Australian Dollar,60 000,83,52%,"Hi, my names Matt my wife and I have been friends with Tony and Tracy for nearly twenty
    years. They are a beautiful family and it was such a shock when I
    got the call from Tony recently telling me of his cancer diagnosis! I’m sure most of you have been following his journey as we have
    and are sending a constant stream of love, positive thoughts and
    prayers their way. I spoke again with Tony last week and heard the n ews of
    the new diagnosis and upgrade from stage 1 to stage 4. Truly heartbreaking to hear, but Tony is as positive and
    faith-filled as always, a true inspiration, we stand strong with
    them believing for a full recovery! He told me briefly of some of the struggles of dealing with the
    unexpected expenses and also the obvious loss of income etc. but
    expressed that he knows that God has it all under control and that he is confident of a positive outcome. After our chat I got off the phone and probably like many of you
    who are not physically located near Tony and Tracy in Sydney
    Australia, I thought to myself, there has to be something we can do to help, so I have set up this campaign in
    the hope that you will all join us in standing together to help make
    a massive difference to Tonys journey! Following is a snapshot of the Dowling family, a link to Tony’s
    journey so far which you can follow and the reasons why our
    donations are so very vital and impactful at this time for them... Tony is 46 years old and has been married to
  Tracy for 19 yrs. They live on the northern beaches of Sydney with
  their two boys Max 16 and Noah 14. The family is heavily involved in
  local basketball through the boy's school and the Manly representative
  level comps. Tracy is involved at the boy's school and helps
  co-ordinate and manage multiple basketball teams. Tony has a background as a school teacher,
  business entrepreneur and currently works in training and software
  development. They are active members of the local community, and
  church and love travelling, family time and adventures of any kind. Tony and Tracy have impacted the lives of so many people around the
  globe and locally with their big hearts and generous souls. We all have been positively influenced by this amazing couple in some
  shape or form, through either school, community, business or church
    life. Here is a link where you can follow Tony’s journey and progress: https://www.mylifeline.org/invitation/FOTY/b53c54fcc2abfed6f3d977439df0c4c309e98f36fff675b0772a480f52894be2 How we can help: Tony has just had surgery to remove bowel cancer which has also
  spread to his right lung. Tony’s diagnosis has now jumped from stage 1 to stage 4! This means that it is full steam ahead for aggressive chemotherapy
  treatment for the next 6 mths, followed by lung surgery around
  November 2019. They are in the process of trying to access some insurance funds, but
  there is a 3 mth waiting period that is not covered and then funds
  will still only cover 3/4 of normal income. On top of that, there are all the additional medical bills, hospital
  expenses, gap payments, medications and day to day additional expenses
  that come with this type of treatment... We want Tony, Tracy and the boys to be able to focus on the important
  things and keep any additional stress to a minimum. We would like to
  provide enough to get them through this 4 month transition period and
  also give them a buffer so that there is not a financial burden and
  pressure on them over the next 6 months. We would like to enable Tracy to not have to take up any additional
  work to cover any shortfall and added expenses, but be able to spend
  the time with Tony and attend to all the necessary appointments and
  give him all the required care and attention needed at this time. After calculating the amount needed to cover their everyday expenses
  keeping them afloat and to keep life as normal as possible, plus
  enough to help cover their ongoing medical costs for the next 6
  months, we have set a goal to raise $60K. Anything above that will go towards any additional ongoing medical
  expenses and treatment required. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless Tony
        and his family at this time as they link arms and stand together
        with friends, and family near and far to fight this nasty thing
        head on! If we all give what we can and share this with our various

  disease, It is the computer of your brain that effects all your
  organs, I had a minor heart attack and minor heart surgery, I had
  Chemo and IVIG and nothing has worked.  This disease has no cure nor
  has any treatment just comfort measures.  This disease has left me
  with lupus and gastroporesis.  I was a nurse and that is what I was
  meant to be, but had to go on disability.  I can have drop attacks,
  this is where you pass out for no reason, Also have dysautonomia,
  Pots.  Small and large tissue nueropathy.  I can't go for a walk
  around my block or go into a store, you see I have to sit a lot, 
  every few steps and business don't have chairs sitting around.  Also
  the cement kills my legs, If I go somewhere like Costco I pay for
  weeks due to the floor.  This bike to me is amazing, being able to go
  out of the house!  I am basically home bound, If I go out I have to
  choose my steps carefully, so I could get some little piece of my life
  back.  My mission is to rare awareness of invisible illnesses, I am a
  patient advocate but now can only do house calls I can't make it in a
  hospital, to far to walk.  I work with patients that have invisible
  illnesses and need a ear to listen, someone who gets it, I also teach
  journaling and guided imagery to PTSD patients even veterans.  My life
  has always been about helping others,  But I can't unless by phone
  now.  The dream of being able to go outside and go around the block is
  huge, something some people will take for granite.  Making a
  difference in someones life is my life but this bike could help me
  help even more people and this bike could help others as well.  Please

153820,Help James McCarthy in his battle against leukemia,U.S. Dollar,100 000,977,154%,"How you can help: Donate to James’ care: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay Register to be a bone marrow donor: http://www.bethematch.org/ James’ Story: On Tuesday, August 7th we were leaving the house for Rita’s birthday
  dinner when we received a voicemail from James’ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be in critical
  condition, on a ventilator, and fighting for his life.  Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed James’ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurie’s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. James’ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurie’s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasn’t a high level
  of concern for James’ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching “gee” (Curious George)
  and looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctor’s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldn’t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didn’t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night James’ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared – and not
  knowing what was happening – we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didn’t. As the night progressed, the doctor’s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, James would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach – how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.  “All done.” “Momma.” “Up.”
  “Outside.” It was heartbreaking and terrifying to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feeling completely helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see.  James’ body
  could not sustain this pace on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossible to hear but we knew it had to be done.  We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.  This was two days after we walked into the hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemia filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. James’ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didn’t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if you’ve met James, you know he is a strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone can battle this, it’s James. While James’ lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasn’t enough.  The doctors decided to move him to a
  new ventilator that could also administer anesthesia gas in addition
  to breathing for James.  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussed unproven options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machine began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.  During “rounds” the next
  morning we counted thirteen doctors and nurses around James’ room to
  get an update on his condition.  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friends – all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15th he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and a pacifier in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. It’s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focused on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own
  home and it’s as easy as swabbing the inside of your cheek. Please visit: http://www.bethematch.org/ You can learn more about JMML at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers.  He’s the
  sweetest little boy you’ll ever meet. We can’t wait to
  hear his voice again. To see his kind blue eyes. To have him blow us a kiss with a smile. I love
    you James. You can donate to James’ care at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay",https://fundrazr.com/f1OA33

510,"Supporting Lani, a transgender woman in a men's prison",U.S. Dollar,1000,21,51%,"My name is Dodie Gibson. I am in dire need of support for my
  wife who is suffering from devastating medical issues while being
  incarcerated in a dangerous men’s prison. My wife Lani is a
  trans woman who is currently incarcerated in Trousdale Turner
  Correctional Center ( a private CCA facility). In 2015 Lani entered Rutherford County Jail where she was immediately
  put in solitary confinement because she is transgender. Within 2 weeks
  and while in solitary, a night guard came in while she was sleeping…
  put a pillow over her head, raped her and told her if she said
  anything he would make sure she was dead. She made her first attempt
  at suicide soon after the attack. The same officer went into her cell a second time in the middle of
  the night while she was sleeping… he held her down and raped her
  again. She stayed silent out of fear for her life. In 2016 she was moved to a Bledsoe State Prison. During that time she
  saw a doctor for a routine medical exam. Lani told the doctor that she
  had been raped twice by an officer at which point she was given STI
  tests. The medical officer did NOT report Lani’s sexual assaults. Her
  STI results came back negative. In Aug. 2016 she was shipped to Hardeman Correctional Center where
  she faced continuous vicious sexual assaults. During the five months
  of her stay at Hardeman, an officer would open her cell door to let
  the inmates inside. Lani prepared a written complaint to a PREA coordinator in the
  compound. The coordinator did not order a rape kit, instead, the
  facility responded by transferring her Trousdale Turner, the worst
  private prison in Tennessee. When Lani arrived at Trousdale, she told the medical officers she was
  raped and wanted to be tested for HIV. They tested her and found she
  was now HIV positive. Since she has been diagnosed, the medical staff
  have continuously missed many of her HIV medications, as well as her
  hormone blockers and mental health meds. She is being denied adequate
  access to both HIV and transitional medical care. I fear for Lani’s health and her life- the fear never leaves me. I am
  reaching out for help because the facility recently stopped giving HIV
  patients the vital nutritional support drinks that are needed to
  ensure their health. The prison also does not provide any form of
  undergarments for the trans women. Most of my funds are spent on daily
  phone calls to make sure that Lani is safe. The funds donated
  here will go towards food and clothing packages to make sure Lani has
  what she needs for day to day survival until she can be transferred to
  a safe facility where she can receive the medical care that she needs. Lani LOVES Pen-Pals. If you would like to reach out to her and send
  her support, please write to: ""Lani"" James Gibson #563634 c/o TTCC 140 Macon Way Hartsville, TN 37074 Please note, If you are a lawyer or can help with legal advise
  regarding Lani's situation it is more than welcome. FAQ about Lani Question: Why are we currently not taking legal action against Core
  Civic in regards to her being sexually assaulted and negligent medical care? Answer: We are currently trying to get Lani moved to a TDOC facility.
  Core Civic has retaliated against her before and have threatened to
  transfer her to another one of their facilities, farther from home and
  they have stated she will be placed in segregation for the rest of her
  sentence (approx. 3 more years.) That would be a death sentence for Lani. Question: Can I make a JPAY account and donate to Lani that way? Answer: Yes, Lani's legal name is James Gibson and her TDOC# is 563634. Question: How can I make sure that donated funds go directly to Lani? Answer: Lani receives receipts for all the funds that are placed in
  her JPAY account. Just let us know if you would like one and we will
  happily mail it to you. Anything other questions, please feel free to ask.",https://fundrazr.com/41SOyf
1470,Help Dylan pay for hernia surgery!,U.S. Dollar,10 000,9,15%,"Howdy, I’m Dylan. I’m a 23 year old with two jobs working my way through art school. When
    I’m not working, I spend my spare time drawing, watching too many
    movies and quoting Star Wars at every opportunity . Since I hate asking for help myself, a friend offered to write
    something up for me. Thanks for reading. Always in motion is the future. --------------------------- Hi there, I’ve worked with Dylan for a little over a year now.
    He’s hardworking, motivated and always has everyone in tears from
    laughter. It was his drive that led him to get a second job to help
    pay for art school and have some more financial stability. His
    second job was far more physically demanding (he’s a smol boi) but
    he’s not one to let that get in the way. Unfortunately, Dylan recently sustained a pretty serious injury
    - two inguinal hernias - that are in desperate need of surgical
    repair. Due to financial constraints, he’s had to postpone two
    different surgical appointments, as well as pay for several doctor’s
    visits. While he has insurance, it isn’t covering the majority of
    the expenses he’s incurred so it’s had to come out of pocket or be
    put onto credit cards. Two months in, the debt is adding up, the
    problem is getting worse by the day and Dylan is in constant pain -
    physically and mentally. He’s having to miss work across both jobs
    on a regular basis, if not from pain caused by the hernias, because
    of crippling migraines caused by the pain and subsequent stress. Point blank, missing work means he’s not making money. Dylan
    is not someone afraid to work for what he has and what he needs. He
    is in a terrible catch-22, as money is what he desperately needs to
    get the surgery. However, his injuries have made it nearly
    impossible to do so. He has to be cautious doing the simplest tasks
    we all take for granted because every day, as he’s at risk of the
    injury becoming more severe. The doctors have suggested surgical
    repair and recovery time as soon as possible to prevent further injury. Your donations would help Dylan: - cover the initial expenses required for scheduling the
    surgery, including (but not limited to) any pre-op office visits,
    blood work, testing, exams, and covering wages lost due to missing
    work to complete those visits - cover wages lost during the minimum two week recovery time
    after the surgery (due to the nature of his jobs) to pay for bills
    and normal living expenses (i.e. rent, utilities, food, gas,
    insurances, etc) - pay for the cost of double inguinal hernia repair surgery not
    covered by insurance until he is fully recovered and bringing in
    money again - have peace of mind and be able to focus all his energy into
    recovering from his surgery, not worrying about bills or
    insurmountable debts Any and all support is greatly appreciated. If you are unable to
    support, please consider sharing this campaign. Please consider donating so we can have our goofy, fun-loving
    Dylan back. Even more, help Dylan get his life back. Emily --------------------------- P.S. Dylan here, I wanted to offer a piece of commissioned
    artwork for donors over $40 to be able to work to earn the help
    offered here while I get back on my feet. Thanks a bunch. P.S.S. Emily again, proof of medical expenses covered with funds
    raised will be available upon request from organizer. We’ll update

      this campaign. All funds donated to this campaign go directly into
      Jesse and Greg's bank account only they have access to. Jessica Russman and I have been friends since we were kids.
      We are more like family. I can't remember a time when I've called
      upon her and she has not come through for me. Now SHE needs
      assistance, and I want within all my power to be at her aide. This
      one is going to take the Village though. Jesse was diagnosed with stage 3 liver cancer several months
      ago and though a successful ablation the cancer was killed, due to
      other illnesses Jesse’s liver does not regenerate. Unfortunately
      she needs a full transplant before the cancer comes back. She is
      currently on the wait list and unable to work. It takes all the
      energy she can muster to spend quality time carrying for her
      beautiful 2 year old daughter Selena. Jesse’s husband Greg is an
      amazing man and has been her rock throughout all of this while
      maintaining all the financial and household responsibilities. Needless to say the medical bills are piling up and becoming
      insurmountable. The Russman’s need help to get over this mountain
      they are about to climb? Cancer is a wicked disease that gives no
      acknowledgement to age or personal circumstance. A liver
      transplant is Jesse's only hope of survival. Jesse and Greg live 90 miles away from the nearest hospital.
      So they have to stay in a hotel with Selena when Jesse has
      treatments.  When Jesse has her transplant she will be in the
      hospital for a month and then it will take 4 to 6 months of
      recovery at home. They will need some in home care for Selena and
      Jesse so Greg can work. Greg can take a leave from work to care
      for them, but he would have to go unpaid. Any help is appreciated.",https://fundrazr.com/JesseRussman
9433,Empowering Recovery & Financial Relief for our Beloved Blu,Canadian Dollar,12000,91,79%,"I am a person who many of you already know had been in health crisis
  several years ago and the fear that gripped me about my future at the
  time was overwhelming.I am so grateful to have found help in many ways
  to regain all of my health and feel younger and stronger than I have
  in over ten years. It was simply because I was lucky that I stumbled
  across the natural health solutions that led me out of my own private despair. So, my friend and fellow Social Entrepreneur with Evolv Health, Judy
  Adolf,  and I have been talking for some time about using the model of
  social giving to help individuals in our community who are overwhelmed
  with a health challenge. It is through no fault of their own they have
  been buried under financial strain which only compounds their health
  issues. We decided to help people with their health in general by
  creating a Wellness focussed community MEET UP GROUP called
  ""PURPOSEFUL WELLNESS which fulfills a mandate to inspire and
  educate others about nutrition, fitness and natural healing methods
  that can help. But we also added a unique component modelling our own
  Evolv Social Business and created a fundraising platform that could
  greatly impact someone suffering with an illness or disability. Many
  face these challenges quite unexpectedly and the financial strain is
  often beyond their ability to cope. So for the first 3 months of  ""Purposeful Wellness"" we
  decided to help our mutual friend Blu Mankuma who is a well loved
  actor/ entertainer in our community currently on Kidney dialysis who
  can no longer work at his profession. He is a kind and loving soul and
  we thought who better than Blu to be our first recipient in the
  charitable program we have implemented. Our goal initially was to raise 2,000. to contribute to his meagre
  income from pensions and disability and since the campaign was so
  successful we have decided to keep going for another 2 months as we
  can see this has brought him such relief and he has a long ways to
  go.. This would to take some of the strain off him so he can buy
  healthy food , pay his rent and perhaps regain some strength through
  an immune support product that he could otherwise never afford. Blu Mankuma's Health Story- ""I'm an actor/director, singer/songwriter and producer.
    When I was in college I began noticing a little swelling around my
    ankles and when I went to the doctor and after several tests, he
    gave me salt pills and told me to keep him apprised. But he had no
    answers and for years the swelling continued. No matter how many
    tests the doctors did, they still had no answers. A few years ago I
    was having dinner, when I felt the need to throw up. On route to the
    bathroom, I lost my balance, I fell and was unable to get up which
    surprised the heck out of me!! I felt like the lady in the
    commercial who says,""help! I've fallen and I can't get up""
    That episode led me to the ICU at VGH for a while and then I was put
    on dialysis which I now do 3 times a week for 4 1/2 sessions. I'm
    unable to do much film work and find it hard to get by on pension
    and disability funds and it has been a struggle just to pay rent. However, I remain positive that one day my kidneys will return to full

  he had a reaction to the Octagam and caused him to end up in hospital
  having lumbar punctures, MRI scans and sonars.  Unfortunately he is
  now unable to receive the Octagam as its a gamble as to whether or not
  he would have the same issues happen again. The option now is to move
  to the subcutaneous medication which is extremely costly. The medical
  aid will cover a portion of this every month, but I am short R5000 per
  month on a 4 week month and R10000 on a 5 week month.  There is also
  the cost of a pump to purchase of over R8000 which medical aid does
  not cover. If I cannot raise enough money, Matthew will not receive
  the correct amount of medication each month, which could lead to more
  infections.  Matthew and I are requesting any form of support no

  School,  let's just say we celebrated the 80's together- LOL Tammy is a caring, loving, kind, spunky, & upbeat gal that I am
  proud to call my friend, as are many others. On November 5th, 2018 Tammy had emergency back surgery. There were
  complications during the surgery. Tammy is now diagnosed as an
  Incomplete Quadriplegic as a result of those complications. (Total
  life game changer to say the least) There are many secondary diagnoses and complications that following
  along with being an Incomplete Quadriplegic. Tammy worked at Cincinnati Eye Institute for many yrs and absolutely
  loves her work family. It was extremely difficult for her to have to
  resign after dedicating herself to helping others. Tammy's resignation
  was due to her newly acquired medical conditions. Tammy is a strong fighter and continues to fight every day in hopes
  of a full recovery! This will take years and a great deal of
  perseverance. It's not something that just happens overnight. Tammy continues to fight and stay strong every day. Tammy utilizes
  everything available to her- Physical therapy, occupational therapy,
  medical appointments, medical procedures and the list goes on... Some bright light did shine on Tammy in January of 2019! She married
  her bestfriend, Scott Wilkins ♡ Scott has been unwavering by Tammy's side. Tammy needs our help now! Let's All, RAISE UP With TAMMY!!! Let's all not only send strength, support and Encourage her along in
  her way through her new journey but let's RAISE UP SOME $$$$ The funds raised will be for Tammy to use as she feels towards
  medical expenses, bills, transport van, and anything that she needs to
  help ensure safety and quality of life during her transition into her
  new normal. No donations are to small or to big! With love and gratitude from Tammy Grubenhoff's friend,  Brandee Goldwire.",https://fundrazr.com/01Se58
1675,Let's help Panagiotis get the cancer treatment he deserves!,Canadian Dollar,3000,27,56%,"Panagiotis Hazapis is the name of one of the most kind-hearted and
  generous people I have ever met. Every day for him is a day of serving
  others. He feeds all the village strays, spends time sharing knowledge
  with the village children, checks in with the aging members of the
  community regularly, and recently saved one of their lives, just
  because he was there and the timing was right. Panagiotis is one of the real victims of the Greek financial crisis.
  After a lifetime of hard work, paying his taxes, and paying in to the
  government pension, doing everything by the book, he now finds himself
  receiving only 1/3 of what his pension was promised to be. Though this
  is hardly enough to support himself and his wife, he would give the
  shirt off his back to anyone in need and never complains about the
  circumstances they've been handed. They have adapted to their
  situation and live modestly, but cannot afford the dilemma they are
  now faced with. We have just learned that Panagiotis has been diagnosed with prostate
  cancer.  The Greek healthcare system will only cover the cost of
  therapy using an archaic radiation machine, which would result in
  numerous side effects and offer a very low success rate. The best
  course of action, a laproscopic surgery to remove the tumor, will cost
  5000 euro (roughly $7500 Canadian dollars), which is something they
  unfortunately cannot afford. Having this surgery would allow him to
  live out his remaining years with his wife by his side, doing what he
  loves most; caring for the village and all who reside within it. If we can find 1000 people willing to sacrifice their Starbucks for a
  day, we have a chance at helping this incredible, selfless man beat
  the odds.  Whatever funds we are not able to raise we will be
  contributing ourselves, so any contribution, no matter how big or
  small, is greatly appreciated. Panagiotis is a proud man and would never want to ask for help from
  others.  Unfortunately pride will not allow him to receive this
  important and life-saving procedure, so we have taken it upon
  ourselves to reach out to the community for help. Thank you in advance.",https://fundrazr.com/a1TAD7

  Melenoma Cancer since April 28rd, 2014. He is an avid CrossFitter with
  16 years coaching and 7 years of CrossFit experience. Jason more
  importantly is a loving husband, son, brother, coach,
  afilliate co-owner at CrossFit North Scottsdale , 2013
  CrossFit Games Master's Athlete (finished 16th M40-44) and friend to
  many. He is originally from Minnesota and lived in Montana 10 years
  before relocating to Arizona in 2003. Since his April 28th diagnosis, Jason had an emotional week after
  finishing the 2014 CrossFit Open ranked 37th in the World (M40-44) to
  being told 3 days later he had malignmant melenoma cancer. There
  were no warning signs. No ""bad moles"" after regular
  dematology checks. He did everything RIGHT. Then just 3 days after
  the news, he was told the cancer had spread to his brain and was
  now terminal stage 4, he had just 3 months to live unless he had
  surgery to remove the brain tumor. Jason underwent brain surgery Friday May 2nd to remove the 1""
  tumor from his occipitical lobe and is home recovering well now. Jason
  and the Dr's attribute the speedy recovery to his excellent fitness
  conditioning from CrossFit ! This is truly just the beginning of the challenges ahead for the
  entire Fine Family. His sister (46) is also has Stage 4 Melenoma
  Cancer and has been fighting it for the past 18 months. Treatment will
  be intense and long. He has additional Gamma Knife treatment scheduled
  May 23rd and then possibly a year of immuno/chemo-therapy after they
  find out what the genetic mutation was. His family, friends and
  community stand behind him in this WAR. We are asking for donations to help with the costs of treatments
  coming this next year, which we all know will escalate quickly. Jason
  does have health insurance but a hgih deducatle plan and no
  perscription drug coverage. He was always healthy and it wasnt needed.
  Now, EVERY dollar you donate will go directly to the chemo therapy and
  medication since he does not have this coverage. This will help Jason
  and his family to focus 100% on his recovery, without any undue stress. Do what you can. This is just the beginning to a year long battle and
  anything is welcome and very much appreciated. Thank you so much!",https://fundrazr.com/2l2q2
255,Help My Mom Kick Cancer!,U.S. Dollar,50 000,6,1%,"Hello, everyone. For those of you that don't know me, my name is
  Amelia Myers. I am a newlywed living in Japan and teaching
  internationally with my husband. I received a phone call the other day
  with possibly the worst news my mind could have imagined. My mother has breast cancer. It was a surreal moment for me. I had never felt so trapped and
  helpless. I honestly thought myself and my family were invincible to
  tragedy like this, but this was not the case. Thankfully, they seem to
  have caught it before it spreads too far, but it will be a long and
  painful battle to prevent any further issues from occurring. She has
  many more appointments to make, future surgeries, future treatments...
  We are not even sure what the botched insurance policies will even do
  at this point. I am trying to do everything I can from abroad to help, but
  unfortunately I have little to no options other than wait, hope, and
  pray. My husband, Jason, and I are planning on returning to the States
  as soon as we can for a visit, but it will take us some time to raise
  enough money to do so. Jason and I didn't get to have a proper wedding
  ceremony due to our quick move abroad (and the funds required for
  moving), so we were planning on returning to have a vow renewal and
  reception party so that our parents could attend. That is even more crucially important to me now. I want my mother to be able to see me in a wedding dress. I want
  my parents to be able to afford to retire and live comfortably, and
  maybe pay us a visit as well once in a while. I want my mother to be
  able to afford her treatment. I want to see my mother kick this and get better. And I need
  your help to do that. Please, consider donating any small amount (even $1 will matter
  in the long run). Every dollar donated will go straight to paying for
  her treatments and medical costs. If there are any extra funds after
  the fundraiser is over, I will personally be donating them to the
  Breast Cancer Research Foundation to help future cases like my
  mother's. Even just sharing this fundraiser would mean the world to my
  family and I. Thank you. --- I will list below the current charges for my mother's medical

9235,SMA fundraising challenge. 15 PLN - £3 for Adaś.,Polish Zlotych,500 000,90,2%,"My name is Ania. I am proud to introduce you a brave, little boy Adaś
  who was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Spinal-muscular-atrophy/pages/introduction.aspx )
   is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and progressive loss
  of movement. Type 1 is the most severe and in most cases causes severe
  respiratory problems which means that children rarely survive beyond
  two years of age. 1 in 5000 children is born with SMA around the world. Please join this SMA fundraising challenge and help Adaś to continue
  his experimental therapy treatment. Adaś Skrzypek  was born just
  before Christmas with the worst type of SMA, type 1. His parents were
  told that he would not reach his first birthday. The doctors informed
  them that there is no cure for SMA at the moment and all they could do
  was to wait for the worst, while his muscles slowly withered away
  until his respiratory system failed and cause Adaś to suffocate. But,
  despite terrifying diagnosis, Aneta and Tomasz Skrzypek, Adaś’s
  parents didn’t give up. They started a daily rehabilitation regime for
  Adaś and started searching around the world for a cure. Adaś's
  condition deteriorated quickly which meant he was no longer offered
  experimental therapies in Europe. He was now not able to swallow or
  breathe properly and was fitted with a tracheotomy tube. Adaś nearly
  died several times but he is a little fighter and was able to start an
  experimental therapy which his parents had found. They didn’t give up
  after being refused help in Europe and they searched around the world
  finally coming across a new treatment in America. The therapy involves
  an injection every 45 days and oral medications in between. Adaś was
  given the first injection just before he turned 6 months old. And a
  tiny mirracle had happened!! Adaś was able to breathe for 20 minutes
  all by himself for the first time in a very long time. He was also
  able to slightly move his head and suck a dummy. There is a realistic
  chance that the experimental therapy that Adaś is receiving will be
  successfull. But unfortunately the cost of the treatment have exceeded
  his parents financial capabilities. The cost of it is 80000 polish
  zlotych (£15,000) every 45 days, and this sum will increase once the
  doses get stronger. By helping Adaś, we are helping children around the world who have
  been or may be born with incurable SMA. We can make a difference and
  change the world. We are giving hope to all the parents who were told
  that the only thing they could do was to give up and wait for the
  worst. Please help by donating any amount in polish zlotych (PLN) or
  the equivalent in another currency and sharing it on Facebook. We can
  spread the word and be a part of something amazing!! We can save
  children all around the world. * You are most welcome to donate as much as you wish. FundRarz and

  wczesnodziecięcy jest najpoważniejszy. Objawy choroby pojawiają sie
  zaraz po urodzeniu lub do szóstego miesiąca życia. Dziecko rzadko ma
  szansę przeżycia dwóch lat. 1 na 5000 dzieci na świecie rodzi sie z SMA. Adaś Skrzypek jest malutkim chłopczykiem, który urodził się 20
  grudnia 2015 roku w Tarnowie. Adaś jest chory na SMA typ 1. Jego
  rodzice, Aneta i Tomasz Skrzypek, przed Wigilią dowiedzieli się, że
  ich długo wyczekiwany synek może nie doczekać swoich pierwszych
  urodzin. Lekarze nie dawali Adasiowi żadnych szans. Jedyne co Państwo
  Skrzypek mogli zrobić, to poddać się i czekać, aż mięśnie Adasia
  zwiotczeją, a uklad oddechowy przestanie działać i Adaś sie udusi.
  Jednak rodzice Adasia z pełną determinacją podjęli poszukiwania
  eksperymentalnej terapii w Europie, która dałaby szansę Adasiowi.
  Niestety po początkowym zakwalifikowaniu Adasia do jednej z terapii,
  stan chłopca pogorszył sie na tyle, że odmówiono jego leczenia. Adaś
  był kilka razy bliski śmierci, ale jest malutkim wojownikiem i przeżył
  po to, by móc wziąść udział w eksperymentalnej terapii, którą znaleźli
  jego rodzice. Nie poddali sie kiedy odmówiono Adasiowi leczenia w
  Europie i rozpoczęli poszukiwania na szeroką skalę na całym świecie,
  aby wreszcie znaleźć nadzieję w Ameryce. Chłopczykowi zaproponowano
  terapię w trakcie, której co 45 dni dostaje zastrzyk, a w między
  czasie przyjmuje leki doustne. Adaś pierwszy zastrzyk dostał niedługo
  przed swoim 6 miesiącem życia. I stał sie maleńki cud!! Adaś był w
  stanie samodzielnie oddychać przez 20 minut, czego nie mógł robić już
  od długiego czasu. Mógł również lekko poruszać główką i trzymać
  smoczek w buźce. Nie mógł tego robić od wielu tygodni. Jest realna
  szansa, że ta eksperymentalna terapia, której Adaś jest poddawany,
  będzie zakończona sukcesem. Niestety, koszt terapii przerósł
  możliwości finansowe rodziców Adasia. Jej koszt, to 80 tysięcy złotych
  co 45 dni. Może to ulec zwiększeniu, kiedy dozy staną się mocniejsze.
  Pomagając Adasiowi, pomagamy dzieciom na całym świecie, które już są
  lub urodzą się chore na nieuleczalną chorobę rdzeniowego zaniku mięśni
  (SMA). Możemy zmienić ich świat i dać nadzieję rodzicom, którym
  powiedziano, że jedyną rzeczą, którą mogą zrobić, to poddać się i

  cancer journey that started way back in 2005. She
  hoped that new posts wouldn't be necessary.  But unfortunately, she
  received some bad news.  Breast cancer.  Again.  For the third time.
   I'll borrow the title from one of her early posts... ""Ain't That Some Shit!"" If you're reading this, you know Treva's personality and can hear her
  voice and brutal honest truth in those words.  You also know her
  strength - her ability to fight endlessly and to also be there for
  every single person when they need her. The financial burden of cancer is beyond tremendous.  It's hard
  enough to go through treatment and all that comes with it.  We want
  for Treva, Marshall and Bella to not feel the strain of medical bills.
   We want for their lives to continue as normally as possible during
  this time.  Would you help make this possible? Hundreds and hundreds of people love Treva and her beautiful

  this storm.  This time it is in the other breast, the “one good boob”. Life has thrown me many curve balls, as it does with us all.  I
  decided this time not to waste energy on being angry or super sad.  I

5510,Miles Turns Two,U.S. Dollar,5000,49,110%,"Miles was born at 9:35PM on June 8, 2017 at Advocate Lutheran General
  Hospital, and it was quickly discovered that something wasn't quite
  right. Miles was gasping for air and showing signs of seizures, and he
  was almost immediately whisked away to the NICU for what would be his
  home for months to come. After four, long days of tests, x-rays, and
  more pokes than one newborn should ever have to endure, it was
  discovered that Miles's ALP levels were ""immeasurable"" and
  many of his bones were so under-mineralized, that they didn't even
  show up on x-ray. While we didn't have genetic confirmation at this
  point (that would come a few weeks later), Miles was diagnosed with
  Infantile Hypophosphatasia - or HPP for short. With his essentially
  nonexistent ALP, Miles is unable to mineralize bones properly. His
  body also struggles with breaking down B6, which cause him to suffer
  from B6 responsive seizures. Thankfully for Miles and the rest of us,
  there is an enzyme replacement therapy that was recently approved by
  the FDA. Miles received his first injection on June 23. It took about two months to start to see some development in Miles's
  bones. His skull that was referred to as ""bone buds"" when he
  was born was finally starting to mineralize. His ribs that looked like
  toothpicks on the first x-ray were showing some strength. We had no
  idea for these first couple of months if the enzyme replacement
  therapy would work. And these x-rays were the first real sign of hope
  because by the end of July, Miles had tired himself out from his
  short, shallow breathing and found himself intubated. After much
  discussion with his doctors, Miles had surgery to get his trach and
  g-tube on August 9. Now you'd think that with a ventilator helping him breathe and the
  enzyme replacement therapy helping him mineralize his bones, we would
  have started to see marked improvement in Miles. But that wasn't the
  case. Miles continued to struggle. Growing bones is apparently quite
  painful (I mean even the great Harry Potter thought so). After some
  advocating by his wonderful nurses, Miles was given a morphine drip
  for the pain. He was also on a number of sedative drugs. It took until
  November, at over 5 months old, for Miles to be weaned off of his IV
  drips and have his central line removed. Even after his central line
  was removed, it took until December for him to be weaned completely
  off of morphine. And on January 16, 2018, after 222 days in the NICU, Miles was
  finally stable enough to come home. But this wasn't the end of Miles's
  medical adventures. Miles came home 100% ventilator and oxygen
  dependent. He also was fed entirely through a g-tube and never took a bottle. For the past year and a half, Miles has made major strides. He's
  learned to sit unassisted, to crawl, and even bear weight on his once
  broken legs. He's grown strong enough to start weaning off the vent.
  And he's begun taking some food by mouth. But Miles still has a
  lifetime of obstacles to overcome thanks to his HPP. For Miles's second birthday, we are raising money for Soft Bones.
  Soft Bones is an amazing organization that has helped us so much in
  Miles's first two years of life. They offer support and resources to
  HPP patients and families. They fund research to help better the lives
  of patients with HPP, and hopefully to one day fine a cure for HPP. We
  are honored to give back to this organization that has given us so much. For more information on HPP or Soft Bones, visit SoftBones.org",https://fundrazr.com/milesturnstwo
355,Help James get something off their chest!,U.S. Dollar,8000,10,4%,"About me: I’m a passionate animal lover from Roanoke,
  VA working at a nonprofit animal welfare organization in the
  Shenandoah Valley (yep, the same one the sad song is about). I was
  privileged as a young adult to spend time in safe spaces, and I found
  the latitude to question my gender. While I was described as a tomboy
  in my childhood, there is perhaps more to the story as an adult. The Challenge: I am deeply rooted to nonprofits and
  cause-based work, leaving little time and energy left towards pure
  capital gain. That said, over my years of questioning, researching,
  listening to trans people’s personal journeys, and amplifying voices
  where and when I can, surgery is going to be part of my transition to
  greater comfort in my own body and my own skin. While I find it
  difficult to put into language the nuance of how I feel in my body,
  the long and short of it is that I’m very uncomfortable with some of
  its features that cannot be the shape I feel they should without top surgery. The Goal: The purpose of this fundraiser is to raise
  money to pay for my top surgery. Donations will go directly to getting
  something off my chest so I can continue my work in the nonprofit
  sector with animals who have no voice otherwise. I humbly ask for your consideration among
  so many other worthy causes. A few dollars, a few cents, is deeply
  appreciated! Every contribution counts! No donation is too small!",https://fundrazr.com/boobsbegone
5720,Kidney for Bryanna,U.S. Dollar,5000,59,114%,"My daughter, Bryanna, needs a kidney. She is 19 years old and is one
  of the hardest working, loving and hilarious young Christian woman I
  have known. Unfortunately, while she was a junior in high school, it
  was discovered that her kidneys were failing. She was diagnosed with FSGS, which causes scarring in the tiny
  filters in her kidneys, rendering them useless. Several medications
  were used in an attempt to slow the progress of the disease but her
  body did not respond.  This past November she had a dialysis catheter
  placed and started dialysis. She does her dialysis at home and has so
  much responsibility between her daily 14 hour dialysis routine, many
  medications, strict diet and weekly clinic appointments. As her health
  declined, she has maintained a part time job and has taken classes at
  community college as she wants to become a registered nurse. She has
  nowhere near the stamina a 19 year old should have but she pushes
  herself so hard. Wait time for a type O kidney in Michigan is 5-5 1/2 years. As a
  parent it is gut wrenching to watch her suffer the fatigue, constant
  nausea, and occasional depression. A suitable live donor has not been
  found. Fort Worth, Texas currently has the shortest wait time in the
  nation at less than a year is estimated. As a result, we are uprooting
  our family and moving to Texas in order to have her listed there. We will be starting over with new insurance deductibles and, due to
  moving expenses, paying her medical costs will be very difficult.
  Please consider donating in order to offset the medical costs for her
  current treatment and help us prepare for a transplant. All donations
  will be kept in a separate account for her medical bills. Ability to
  afford medical expenses (such as post transplant anti-rejection
  medications) is necessary in order to be listed for transplant. We appreciate all support, whether it is monetary, a prayer or a word
  of encouragement. Please be sure to consider becoming a registered
  organ donor and be sure your family is aware of your wishes. There are
  so many people like Bryanna who are waiting. Thank you so much for reading this and for caring.",https://fundrazr.com/11Ugn5

  maintains since the tragedy. Albeit, he grew up in the inner city and
  managed to avoid major incidents of violence involving guns, drugs and
  gangs. He knew it was incumbent to remain focused on his goals of
  living a very disciplined life by never drinking alcohol or using any
  kind of drugs, thus avoiding conduits possibly predisposing themselves
  such a tragic outcome. Zuberi at the very time of the shooting worked
  three jobs, seven days a week, while raising two children along with
  pursuing his goals and dreams of being an entertainer (actor, model,
  dancer, rapper and writer). Post the immediacy of the incident, he has
  survived two life threatening surgeries with his heart stopping twice
  on the operating table. Afterwards, and as he convalesced, while
  bedridden for a year, with countless prayers, tears, family and
  community support, he regained physical strength and emotional
  resiliency (although punctuated by intense, constant, and chronic pain
  related to the remaining bullet fragments in his spinal cord and
  chest; 25 years post-incident, he continues to endure the never-ending
  constant, excruciating, chronic, physical pain induced by the bullet
  fragments that remained in his spine). Once stabilization period peaked Zuberi began volunteering by
  mentoring to youth, doing motivational speaking engagements, at
  numerous schools, churches, and social programs; ALL at his own
  expense never charging a fee for his services! Desirous of furthering
  his formal education, Zuberi went back to school and began to
  matriculate his degree and in May, 2000 he was conferred with a
  Bachelor of Arts degree in History Education from Clark Atlanta
  University in Atlanta, Georgia. Currently Zuberi has a T4 Spinal Cord injury, as well as bone on bone
  cartilage wrist damage, as a result of 25 years of confinement in his
  wheelchair and years of operating his wheelchair manually. His
  recommended treatment for his condition is Stem Cell Treatment and
  Rehabilitation. He is requesting this project be funded As Soon As
  Possible in order for him to benefit from this crucial and essential
  surgery. In addition, he is a prolific writer and film producer with
  an ultimate goal to complete his book and documentary projects titled,
  “Dreaming Beyond My Circumstances”; highlighting  his “ tragedy to
  triumph” story to encourage others that no matter what their adversity
  in life or circumstances they live with, to never give up. Zuberi
  hopes to exemplify that you can still make it no matter your
  circumstances. He wants to shout from the mountaintops, “Just don’t
  give up on your dreams, goals and aspirations, and NEVER give up the
  fight!” His ultimate goal is to walk, dance and run again through this
  vital Stem Cell Treatment. On behalf of Zuberi Mwanathaura, we wish to Thank You in advance for
  your prayers, your financial support, your love and sharing his story
  through social media, and with your friends & families. Please join us in our campaign to Help Zuberi Walk Again in 2019!! Speech in link below of Zuberi doing a Motivational Speech to High

3805,Ceiling lift for Ryan’s 12th birthday,U.S. Dollar,38 000,28,101%,"Our son, Ryan, is 11 years old and suffers with Miller Dieker
  Syndrome. He needs total care for all of his needs and daily
  activities. He is now 74 pounds and getting so heavy for us to lift.
  We have sent a letter of medical necessity and applied twice for a
  lift to Ryan’s Medicaid but have been denied even after appealing. His
  12th birthday is coming up on June 21st and the only thing I can think
  of that he needs is a manual ceiling lift. This will help us safely
  get him from his bed to his wheelchair or to his bath chair. He has
  been getting bed baths for a year now despite having a rolling bath
  chair and a walk in shower to use because it is no longer safe for us
  to lift him especially when he is wet from the shower. He also goes
  many places throughout the week (church, therapy, and family outings)
  and we do not want him to be limited from these activities because we
  can no longer lift him and put him in his wheelchair. We do not want
  him to become bed bound. We have found a manual ceiling lift and track
  system at the lowest price possible that will meet his needs and have
  attached pictures. Thank you for sharing or story or donating to his
  fund for his 12th birthday!",https://fundrazr.com/91VMaf

    short amount of time - brain surgery, blood transfusion, days of
    severe pain throughout her body, high fevers, extreme nausea, hair
    loss, and she just finished 6 weeks of chemotherapy and yet, the
    list goes on. The
    location of concern is against her brain stem and her oncologist

    aggressive with the likelihood of damage happening. The sooner
    Ependymoma is removed completely, the better it will be for her. We
    are praying and having faith that Georgia will be completely healed
    and a second brain surgery will not have to happen ✝️❤️ She had an MRI on Tuesday morning. While they await the determination for a second brain surgery, I need your help and support to give back to Georgia and her

10720,Stan Romanek Medical /Life FundRazer,U.S. Dollar,15000,146,71%,"I'm adding the story behind this fund raiser so you may
    understand who, what, when, where and most importantly why. Who: Stan Romanek is an ordinary man who experiences
    Extraordinary events. Stan is an innocent individual who has been
    convicted of a horrendous crime. A crime against children. Stan
    maintains his innocence, and his friends and family stand by his
    side knowing he would never harm a child, not even by looking at
    pictures of abuse by others. Stan is a father,stepfather, step-Papa, husband, brother, son,
    friend and a lifeline of understanding & support to many people
    around the world. What: It all began in Dec. 2000 when Stan witnessed and
    documented his first UFO. His experiences of contact with ETs/UFO's
    still continues just not as often. More....What: Over the past 17 years Stan has endured threats,
    physical assaults, being shot at, called a fraud and worse. Stan has also received love, praise, thanks, respect, from
    around the world, and according to some a little fame. Netflix
    movie, EXTRAORDINARY:The Stan Romanek Story is a documentary about
    his life and experiences. In 2013 A detective named Koopman arrived at Stan's home with
    a search warrant, an armed SWAT Team, and 2 persons from a forensics
    lab. The team spent 2 1/2 hours in his home, searching. They found
    no evidence of what they were searching for. ( What...Child Porn) No
    disk, no jump drive, no picture, or any trace on any computer!!!! When: April 2013...search warrant When: February 2014 Stan was arrested. He spent 12 hours in
    jail. That's how long it takes to bail someone out. When: 4 1/2 years after the search warrant, August 2017 Stan
    was found guilty of possesion of CP by a 12 member jury. Stan does not blame the jury. They weren't give all of the
    evidence in this case. They weren't allowed to know that Det.
    Koopman had faced his own felony charges in 2016 for basically lying
    to a judge in a murder case pre-trial. He was found not guilty.
    However, the detective was placed on a Brady list. A list for police
    officers who lie in their official capacity. No one could tell the jury about this in Stan's trial, they
    didn't know of the other cases the Det. lied in or that there were 2
    civil lawsuits against the detective. A lot of evidence and witnesses provided for Stan's defense
    was not allowed or were limited in what they could say. This is not how the justice system us supposed to work.
    Innocent people found guilty and guilty people found innocent???? Where: Loveland Colorado, Larimer County. Why: WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO STAN?? The reason is simple. Silence the messenger! Our therory is that the evidence found 10 months after the
    search warrant was planted. The evidence proves our therory!!!
    Evidence not seen by the jury! How: Malicious activity!!! Virus with backdoor access, a bad
    cop, a dark agency bent on silencing Stan, someone who simply didn't
    agree with Stan's message of the ET/UFO reality????? Who knows!?! The end of this Story is still to be written. On October 19, 2017 Stan will appear in court for sentencing. Nothing can change that fact. The judge is a good judge, and
    Stan's fate is in her hands. What can be done to finish this Story? Please share this
    fundraiser. Donate whatever amount you can, and assist Stan in
    getting an appeal. Justice for Stan is our mission. Do you Stand with Stan? #IStandWithStan PAYPAL Donations: lisaromanek@yahoo.com Thank you, blessings, love and gratitude to you all!",https://fundrazr.com/d1HMsc

  immobile and incapable of caring for herself. The results of the
  stroke caused Complex Regional Syndrome, Vascular Dementia, Aphasia
  and have severely shifted her life activities. Rose’s family is unable to fully provide the financial assistance to
  help her receive the care needed to get better, heal and get back the
  fun, vibrant colorful life she lived & felt just a year ago. Rose is surrounded by many friends and family who help take care of
  her around the clock but unfortunately with climbing medical bills
  from physical therapy, doctor’s visits, and the medication needed 2
  times a day- it’s getting more and more difficult. Update on Rose Rios 4.29.19 Rose was hospitalized 2 months ago & has digressed a bit, but is
  still stable. Her everyday routine continues to be a struggle with her
  waking up, using the restroom, eating, taking medicine and traveling
  to appointments. After seeing many specialist, they have concluded that hyperbaric
  oxygen treatments will help with her health and prolong her life. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing pure oxygen in a
  pressurized tube. The Hyperbaric chamber is used to treat stroke
  victims with significant results. The price for this is $1,920/mo, including an oxygen mask, plus a
  lift fee to place her in the chamber. The doctors would like to do
  this for 2-3months, to see if it substantially improves her recovery. Any donations, advice or help is truly appreciated to help us as we

2240,Elsie & Emma's Fundraiser for Lurie Children's Hospital,U.S. Dollar,2000,28,112%,"Just recently Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago has touched the
  lives of two sweet little girls in our family. For any parent, your
  worst fear is something happening to your children. Our experiences
  were nothing short of terrifying. When we first received the news that our little ones had something
  serious going on we immediately felt fear, panic, stress &
  helplessness. At one point both Elise & Emma were at Lurie
  Children's Hospital at the same time. When you walk through the doors
  at Lurie Children's Hospital you feel a sense of relief come over you.
  Every single staff member from the ER staff, the surgeons, the nursing
  staff, cafeteria employees, security guards and everyone in between
  are what get you through your stay. We as a family would like to pay it forward. Lurie Children's
  Hospital was beyond excited when we brought up doing a book drive for
  them. They are always looking for new toys & books for their
  family and patient play areas and even gifts for each patient to bring home! When Elsie had her emergency surgery she was not nervous at all and
  that is thanks to all of the incredible staff. They treated her and my
  husband like FAMILY. She now has a book that she brought home upon her
  release and points it out and says 'that's what I got from the
  hospital'. To some this may not be much but to us, it means she
  doesn't remember the bad or scary. When Emma's surgeon came out to tell us the good news I had that
  moment you see on T.V where all you can do is break down and cry and
  hug them. The staff was nothing short of the BEST. As Emma & Elsie still continue their road to 'recovery' we hope
  to continue receiving great news & bless the staff at the next
  follow up with boxes of books & toys! If you have had a similar experience please feel free to join us in
  helping give back to those who made our stay at Lurie as pain free as possible.",https://fundrazr.com/01WHXb
33884,Helping Heidi with Cancer Treatments,U.S. Dollar,100 000,226,34%,"For those that don’t know me I’m Heidi! For everyone else, Hi! And, if you haven’t heard already, please visit my website at https://peanutbutterandcancer.com/ for the full shebang. For those of you that may not be able to visit the website... Here’s the skinny. I have brain cancer. I know what you’re feeling, shock, me too
    when I first found out. It started when I was in North Carolina visiting my mom who was
    having a benign brain tumor removed on October 18th. (She’s
    recovering great.) While there, I began having some difficulty
    reading, super aggressive vomiting, and ultimately a raging
    headache. This lasted for a couple of days. My Nanny fortuitously
    took me to the ER in our hometown to, at the very least, get some
    fluids. During that visit, the docs did a CT scan which showed
    evidence of pressure on my brain and the team recommended further
    testing. So I flew back to Denver, CO on October 23. Noah (my
    husband) and I went to Porter ER for follow up. An MRI revealed a
    mass in my brain and they suggested immediate surgery. On 10/25 I
    underwent a successful surgery to remove the visible portions of the
    25mm mass and the tissue was sent out for testing. I was released
    from the hospital on 10/28. On November 1st, I found
    out I have the deadliest of all 120 types of brain tumors, Stage 4
    Glioblastoma (GBM). And... about 3 weeks ago we received some exciting news.  I tested
  positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV).  Which means the CVM is
    found in 60% of all GBMs.  It's also found in the stem cells of all
    GBMs.  This gives us reason to think the cause of the cancer could
    be from a virus. Which we are currently treating with antiviral
    medications. So, in a world of medicine that's not quite sure what
    to do with GBMs, this gives us a place to start. So, we got some fighting to do, huh? Here’s what treatment looks like. First I radically changed my diet (bye bye sugar and peanut butter) Then we started taking every supplement under the sun that is
    rumored to have anti-cancer properties. After consulting our naturopathic oncologist and nutritionist,
    we've narrowed down what supplements work for me.  Luckily, I've
    been able to take less pills. Yay! We've done the radiation and the first round of chemo. I'll
    still be doing small doses of chemo for the next 6 months. I’ve also been doing a number of alternative and spiritual
    treatments: sound bath, reiki, acupuncture Soon I’ll be starting Optune. (This is the part where I shave my
  head). You can check it out here if you want more info ... https://www.optune.com/ This is what I'll look like with the Optune on What I need from you. Send positive vibes. If you believe in Quantum Physics, you know
    energy can heal. Forward any contacts or resources you may have surrounding
    successful GBM treatments. Consider a monetary donation. Unfortunately, stupid cancer isn't
    cheap. GBM is like a needy, expensive house guest that doesn't know
    when to leave. If you feel compelled to donate, we appreciate your contribution.",https://fundrazr.com/pbandcancer

  aggressive tissue decaying infection in his left leg below the knee
  December 2016 with the initial diagnoses by several doctors to
  amputate the leg above the knee. Dr. Mar Chavira at Salvatierra
  hospital in La Paz did not share that opinion and initiated treatment
  and procedures to rescue the limb and avoid an pending
  amputation. The goal of this fundraising..if met...would cover
  our medical expenses incurred so far (+/-9,500,-US $) as well the cost
  of living / debt accumulated during the time of the illness and
  recovery without any income and would supply the funding required to
  find another rental moving to a better location with option to work
  for him (+/- 5500,-US $) Please read explanation in details further
  down and in the blog we have started. Basically we are not capable on our own power to leave the
  sub-average lifestyle zone we are in right now and funding would
  provide a huge help to Thomas Ernst and me assisting to restart our
  life to a ""normal"", simple lifestyle level again. This
  is basically ""our story"" in a nutshell. Please read in

  do not have a professional background to create such fundraiser pages
  as this here in the proper way and writing. My English also has
  severe flaws and I apologize for that. It is work in progress as
  we been forced to change the fundraiser platform due to the
  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe
  and by their policy is Mexico a Non-GoFundMe supported Country
    and they will shut down. You find info on this here You can see screenshots of received donations during the past 2
  weeks here on our blog . The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.

  a clerical position in a hotel working night-shifts. We have sold any valuables to create funds, we have no vehicle. Ernst

41026,Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,177000,666,23%,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.

3311,Judy Gerdis Needs Costly Oral Chemo for Metastatic Breast Cancer,U.S. Dollar,9000,37,37%,"Hello, I am Tom and Judy Gerdis’ daughter, Trina Sutherland.
     Some of you may be aware in April of this year my mother, Judy, was
    told by her physicians that the breast cancer she fought hard to rid
    her body of in 2008 through 2009 has returned and is attacking her
    bones.  It is currently on a femur, in her tailbone,  shoulder,
    neck, some parts of the spine, and her lower skull. We were excited
    to learn through scans none of her organs have been affected. And we
    want to keep it that way! She began a 10 day treatment of radiation two weeks ago. Now she is
  waiting for her white blood cell count to recover so she may begin the
  oral chemo treatment called Ibrance. Ibrance is a very costly
  prescription. After insurance, it costs $2235.00 for a 21 day supply.
  This prescription could possibly need to be administered for the next
  year. I hope that we can all rally around my parents at this time so
  they will not have to refinance their home in order to pay for this
  lifesaving medicine. The cost of this one drug for a year is  close to
  $30,000. The first month is covered and then we have 30 days to band
  together before the bills hit for each new month’s prescription.  This
  is not including her other medications and treatments. My mom is determined to win this battle once more. Tom and Judy are
  confident the Lord is walking her through this journey  and the
  Father’s amazing healing works will be demonstrated mightily. Thank you for your donations and prayers! Every little bit will help
  my mom continue to fight the good fight. Please follow this page at
  the bottom to keep up with updates. If Ibrance is discontinued,
   whatever monies are raised will go to any other medical expenses my
  parents may incur.   Blessings!",https://fundrazr.com/f1VFVf
702077,British Gut,U.S. Dollar,17000,45,4%,"This is a unique, open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and
  analyzed. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab about every 2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once
  your sample arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), processing takes 3-4
    months. We estimate that the whole process will take about
    4-6 months. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized interpretation . It will take longer than the expected 4-6 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome. Note your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the British Gut Project help
      account ( info@britishgut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be
        deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;

    collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data from
    populations across the globe. The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 If You Live in the U.S.: Joining is

    the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if you would like
    to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed as a perk,
    email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in the U.S. from some
    locations can be expensive , so it is recommended that you look into the cost of return
    shipping (it is highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more
    reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3-4 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of

1100,Help Shannon get out of her house!!!,U.S. Dollar,22 000,10,51%,"Hello! I’m Shannon Flowers from Seattle Washington. Some of you know
  my predicament but maybe you don’t. In 2012, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer. I spent that year
  going through radiation and chemotherapy. As of 2013 I was cancer free. As time went on I developed neuropathy (numbness) in my feet and
  fingers from the chemo I had.  I drop a TON of things and I wobble
  while walking. I’ve developed chronic 24/7 pain in both feet.  I tried
  to go back to my pre-cancer job but with my fingers being numb I
  became a liability. Another side effect started in 2016 in late Fall.  I felt lethargic.
  I was sick all the time. I felt like I had the flu for weeks. After 5
  months of intense tests and soooo much blood drawn we figured out what
  it was. I had SLE, or to non-medical folks, systemic lupus. Lupus is a disease of the immune system. Normally your immune system
  protects the body from infection. With lupus, however, the immune
  system attacks tissues in various parts of the body. I have joint
  pain, we’ve determined that my lupus is starting to affect my kidneys
  and some muscles. I also have extreme fatigue. This paired with
  chronic pain is devastating. I learned of the Alinker bike from an article on how actress Selma
  Blair has one and it helps her MS greatly. I have problems walking with my neuropathy and lupus adds even more
  numbness to my feet and fingers. I stumble often. My fatigue limits my
  activity. I do have a rolling walker to take places but even on a trip
  to get groceries the activity will make me take a 3-5 hour nap when I
  get home. As some of you know, I had the Seattle Geekly podcast with my husband
  and we’d go to a ton of geek conventions. I haven’t been to any
  conventions in the past 3 years. My social life is gone. I have to beg
  off so many family and friend occasions. I believe that if I had the Alinker bike I would be able to attend
  conventions again. You sit on the seat and have your legs move. Since
  one of my needs is breaks to sit every few minutes I really think I
  could get out of the house more with it. I think I’d be able to travel more. I used to really love shopping in
  a mall. My friends or my sister and I would walk around, socialize and
  (sometimes) buy things. I didn’t think it might be a possibility until
  I learned of this. I don’t like the thought of having to get a scooter. It’s confining. This bike looks like freedom to me. My rheumatologist always tells
  his patients to try to get outside and walk. I don’t have enough
  mobility right now to be able to do that right now. So if you can help, please donate so I can be confident and leave the
  house. Possibly see you at a convention soon. I really appreciate it.❤️ BTW- The amount shown I need to raise is the bike + tax Thank you for reading my story!",https://fundrazr.com/e1XWDf
15822,Eveolution,Pound Sterling,20 000,141,79%,"In July 2014, 2-year-old Eve McGonigle was diagnosed with an
  extremely rare and life-threatening brain tumour called Ependymoma.
  After weeks of mis-diagnosis, Eve was extremely ill, struggling to
  walk, talk or even eat. The life was sucked out of her and it was
  agonising to see the once mischevious and adorable toddler struggling
  to survive. Eve's condition drastically deteriorated and after a visit
  to the Borders General Hospital was rushed to Edinburgh's Sick Kids
  for emergency treatment after a brain scan determined the unthinkable.
  This was truly devastating and soul destroying for Eve's family who
  could only rally around and pray for a miracle, whilst Eve lay almost
  unrecognisable in a ward bursting with other young children fighting
  for their lives. Upon arriving at the hospital, Eve was taken in and cared for by the
  magical staff and nurses of Ward 7. The procedures and life-saving
  treatment that Eve required were terrifying for both Eve and her
  family, however the miraculous nurses and medical staff were
  constantly on hand 24 hours a day to help with their calming and
  loving nature, somehow helping to make the six week stint in a stark
  hospital bed bearable. These people dedicate their lives to ensure the
  young children that enter the ward have the very best chance of making
  it out in full health, so we want to give something back. EVEolution has been set up to help the staff and patients of Ward 7
  to improve the facilities on the ward to allow children fighting this
  deadly disease and their families find some sort of comfort and solace
  throughout this stressful time. If you would like to help us make a difference we would be forever
  grateful knowing that with your generous support we have made a
  difference to help future children like Eve and their families having
  to battle through this terrifying experience. When you are smacked in
  the face with a heartbreaking matter such as Eve's we know it would
  make a difference to find a little more comfort in an alien environment. We will keep you up to date with projects on our twitter and Facebook page. Thank you, thank you, thank you. @eveolution facebook.com/eveolutionUK",https://fundrazr.com/Eveolution

18060,Tiffany Smith Johnson Stroke Fund,U.S. Dollar,304,33,6%,"Tiffany Johnson (our beloved Psychic Tiff) suffered a stroke on Friday afternoon January 18th, 2013.  She was immediately rushed to the hospital where CT and MRI confirmed our worst fears; it was a massive Arterial Dissection. Arterial dissection refers to the abnormal formation of a tear along the inside wall of an artery. As the tear becomes larger, it forms a small pouch which doctors call a “false lumen.” Blood pools inside the wall of the artery until it begins to impede blood flow. The blood inside the false lumen can clot and extend slowly into the area where blood normally flows. This can limit or completely interrupt blood flow to a part of the brain. Small pieces from the growing blood clot can break off, flow upstream, and become trapped inside a smaller artery in the brain. Tiffany underwent a 5 hour surgery to save her life. She was then taken to ICU where we prayed the worst might be over and recovery could begin. Within 24 hours her brain swelling became so severe a second operation was required to once again save her life.  A portion of her skull had to be removed in order to make room for the brain to swell without doing further damage. The prognosis at this point was grim, the family was told that she may not survive, but we all had hope.  Tiffany just turned 40 years old is in peak physical condition, if anyone had a shot at beating this, it was her. CT scans we're performed every 24 hours and a team of doctors, surgeons and nurses monitored her 24/7. Tiffany was giving us small signs that she was fighting and seemed to understand what was happening.   Within a few hours of her second surgery she actually gave us the ""thumbs up"" – our hope and optimism soared. She spent several days in ICU hooked up to various machines and was being administered powerful medications.  She was then moved to progressive care where she spent several more days under 24 hour care.  She was far from out of the woods at this point but remained stable and was continuing to fight. Tiffany stabilized enough to be moved to a standard care room where she spent several, more days.  She was heavily sedated and unable to communicate, but as the fog began to lift the doctors we’re able to determine the extent of her injuries, and the news was saddening.  About 2/3 of the right brain hemisphere had died due to lack of oxygen.  She was paralyzed on her left side and had no feeling in or use of her left arm and left leg.  Her speech was almost non existent and there appeared to be serious vision problems.  We were told some of these symptoms might improve once the brain swelling stopped and began to subside. After 6.5 days of being virtually comatose Tiffany opened her eyes and was able to mouth a few words.  She still had use of her right arm and leg and was able to point out her needs and areas of pain.  It was at this point we finally received some positive news, Tiffany was able to swallow.  Had she lost this function her future would have taken a very different direction.  We began to feed her spoonfuls of juice and her favorite, ice chips. With each passing day she was able to speak a few more words and we were thrilled to realize that she knew what month and year it was, she knew her birth date, her husbands name and more.  Tiffany was still there but trapped in a body she no longer had control over.  On Day 12 Tiffany was transferred to the Rehabilitation Center in the hospital where she will remain indefinitely. Tiffany’s story remains unwritten but we believe she was chosen for a very specific reason.  Many believe Tiffany is a living breathing angel of God.  During her career as a Psychic, Author, Speaker and Healer she has affected thousands of people in a very positive way.  She has changed lives for the better and the world is a better place because she is in it.  She has brought inspiration and hope to so many but we believe her story of recovery will be the most inspiration gift of all.  Tiffany will shine & sparkle once again, but the journey will be long and difficult. Its clear Tiffany’s future is forever changed.  If she is able to return home someday she will require 24/7 nursing care for several months.  Her home will need to be modified to accommodate her disabilities.  Special equipment, beds and safety features will be required.  God willing she is able to drive a car again she will need a special vehicle with handicap capabilities.

  enjoys reading, video games, hanging out with his friends, and, like
  most kids, fighting with his brother and sister. In October 2011, Sebastian was diagnosed with Stage IV
  Neuroblastoma, a cancer that starts in the nerve cells, and is rarely
  found in children over the age of 4. He is nearing the end of a long,
  difficult road. His initial treatments were at St. Louis
    Childrens. He has endured 6 rounds of high-dosage chemotherapy, a
    bone marrow transplant, 18 bone marrow biopsies, a major surgery to
    remove a large mass from his abdomen, and countless tests and scans.
    He had 2 rounds of mibg radiation therapy in Cincinnati, OH, and 40
    rounds of palliative radiation at Carle Hospital in Champaign, IL.
    He also received treatment at Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago,
    where he had a team of oncologists who specialize in Neuroblastoma.
    We were unable to improve his disease. In July 2014, following
    complications due to chemo, Sebastian decided to stop treatment.
    He's been on hospice care ever since then.",https://fundrazr.com/BastianHope
500,Save Nevaeh's Life From Nephropathy,U.S. Dollar,500,1,100%,"Nevaeh's condition is called IgA Nephropathy which is an ESRD or end
  stage renal disease. Her particular disease is caused by a genetic
  calcification disorder which is causing all of her organs to turn into
  stone. Neither one of her kidneys are functioning correctly and she is
  on dialysis 3 days a week. Nevaeh is also receiving one pint of blood
  every dialysis treatment because her bone marrow has been completely
  depleted and is no longer producing red blood cells. The primary reason we're trying to find funding is so Nevaeh can find
  other doctors that are willing to help treat her for her full set of
  needs, not necessarily the way they treat patients on Medicaid and
  Medicare. She has been fighting her whole life to survive her
  nephropaty with the means she chould afford, and her hope is that with
  a little bit of outside help and encouragement that she will be able
  to see more capable doctors, such as the Saints Vincents transplant
  team  in Cincinnati Ohio. They transplant out of Indiana and she is a
  decent candidate for their program, but it costs a lot of money and
  she's been working very hard for it. Nevaeh has recently lost both her

279,Help Garrett See Colors,U.S. Dollar,279,8,100%,"MY COLORBLIND STORY My kindergarten teacher used flash cards to teach us the colors,
  numbers, and letters. I learned the letters and numbers quickly, but I
  had a lot of difficulty learning the colors. I didn't understand why
  something that came so easy to the other kids was so difficult for me.
  My teacher noticed my frustration and pulled me aside to teach me the
  colors one-on-one. She noticed that I was getting a lot of the colors
  right but there were a few that I would mix up: green and brown, blue
  and purple, orange and red. She quickly concluded that I must be
  colorblind. She told me that it's okay that I was getting some colors
  wrong because there were some colors my eyes just couldn't see. It
    wasn’t my fault. She let my parents know her discovery and my
  mom said that her father is colorblind and so I must have gotten it
  from him. Luckily for me, my colorblindness is not very severe. I grew up and
  went through school like a normal kid. Sometimes I would use the
    wrong colors and draw a tree with brown leaves and a green
  trunk , but usually I did a good job of asking a friend or a
  teacher what color something was if I wasn’t sure. To this day I pick
  colors based on their names or RGB codes instead of how they “look”
  since I can’t trust my eyes to tell me the right thing. In high school I took a color vision test online. Color vision tests
  consist of a bunch of dots on a screen where certain letters or
  numbers are visible or invisible depending on what type of color
  vision you have. Based on what things I could and could not identify
  in each image, the test concluded that I have deuteranomaly ,
  meaning that I can see green but not very well. Basically I can see
  100% of blues, 50% of reds, and 25% of greens. I would like to get Enchroma color vision corrective glasses so that
  I can see greens and reds better. I would love to see how vivid green
  grass really is. I would love to see the deep red color of heart
  emojis. I want to see a rainbow in full color for the first
  time. That is why I need your help to raise money to get the
  Enchroma glasses. Please contribute if you can. Every little bit counts! WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

  For those of you that do know Ben, I am still sorry. But you know
  why..... (lol) Ben hit a cold reality when he was recently diagnosed with bladder
  cancer. It was a shock to say the least. He is too young and not ready
  to stop making people laugh. He wants to fight.  But he has a problem..... Ben is on Medicare. He does not have prescription drug coverage. The
  one medication he has to take at home to build his white blood cells
  after the chemo kills them off is $4,752 a prescription. He has 7
  refills. That's $33,264 for this prescription for his 4 cycles of
  chemo, and the month after. If he does not get this medication, the
  chemo will surely kill him. This medication will help him fight off
  infection since his white blood cells will no longer have those
  capabilities. There are organizations that will help, and he is in
  communication with them.  However, they are slow to reply and he needs
  to be sure he has financing. He was able to get the first prescription free. Ben has always had 2 goals in life... The first goal is to laugh and
  make others laugh. He went to the hospital telling people he was
  worried about a certain test because he didn't get to study for it. Of
  course, everyone laughed. He loves having parties and getting family
  together. He is always there for his Mom Evelyn, and his sister Lisa.
  He takes care of me, the house and my parents. Ben is a big guy with
  an even bigger heart. His other goal is to work. He is a truck driver and loves being on
  the road. He makes overnight deliveries while seeing the country. An
  active member Fraternal Organization of Eagles #3138 (Taylor, MI), he
  has often stopped in clubs around his delivery locations just to
  support the organization. All he wants to do now is get back to work
  and feel whole again. I am Suzette Pariseau and I have been Ben's better half for more
  than 6 years.  I am an ESL teacher and can take time off work to help
  him, but I do not get paid for the time I take off. Financially, I
  have to take care of our regular bills to keep us afloat.  Ben is also
  a proud man and would never ask for monetary help, so I am doing it
  for him. If you can donate and help him pay for his medications, it
  would be greatly appreciated.  Any amount would help. If you need any
  more information than what I have already posted, or would prefer to

350,Help us give our son the gift of color.,U.S. Dollar,349,10,100%,"Hey Everyone! For those of you who don't know, my 5 year old son Victor is
  Protan color blind. What does that mean? To break it down, he can see some colors but not most. For example, super bright shades
  of color he can usually pick up on so long as the lighting in the room
  or outside is good. Other shades of color (especially darker colors)
  all begin to look the same. Some examples? I asked my son to
  tell me what colors the following texts are. These are the colors and
  his responses: What color is this? Orange! So what color does this look like to him? Green! How about this color? What
            does he see? Purple! What color does he see here? Brown He knows that he is color
                blind but doesn't really understand it. How do you explain to
              someone that the color they see isn't really the color
              they see? Being color blind has
                caused interference with his lessons and daily play. He does the best he can
                despite being color blind and reassures me when he
                sees the look on my face. The one I get when I'm too heartbroken to let him
                know he got a color wrong. Like the day we drove by an
                orange excavator. He loves excavators and gleefully
                pointed it out. Only, he called it blue. I asked him to
                repeat what he had said. He hesitantly told
                me...""blue?""... I tried to put on my most
                cheerful voice and tell him he was right, that it was a
                beautiful blue excavator. But he knew already that he
                had gotten it wrong. I have a terrible poker face. He
                smiled and told me that it was ok because I was going to
                buy him super hero glasses so that he could see colors.
                I cheerfully agreed with him hoping he didn't hear my
                voice crack from the strain of trying not to cry. My pain that day wasn't from my son being color
                blind. My pain was from the promise echoed from my son.
                That Mommy will buy him ""super hero glasses""
                so that he can see colors. I made him that promise the
                day we found out he was color blind. And I have worked
                so hard ever since that day to make good on my promise
                to my son. Wouldn't you know that life keeps getting in
                the way? I'm sure everyone who reads this will
                understand what I mean by that. Every single time my
                husband and I start gathering up enough spare money to
                buy our son his Enchroma glasses something happens to
                set us back financially. Car dying, expensive dental
                care, new roof, etc, etc. The list continues as life
                continues. It's beyond frustrating to begin with for
                anyone. But to know that every time something happens it
                is another month (and another, and another, and
                another...) that I can't make good on my promise to my
                son... well that, as I'm sure you already know if you
                are a parent, is gut wrenching. To the point where I'm
                now doing something I never thought I'd do...I'm asking
                for help. I've never met anyone who likes asking
                for help including myself. Sure I'll ask for help
                reaching something too high up or perhaps an extra hand
                to help carry in the groceries. But humbling myself to
                ask for help on a financial level is something I try to
                avoid doing at all costs. However, for my son, I will. So if you are reading this, and if you have any
                capacity and desire to help, I am asking you for it. I
                do not ask lightly. I really doubt I'll ever be able to
                pay you back which is why it makes this so hard for me.
                I don't mind asking for something I can repay. It's
                having to ask people for nothing more than their sheer
                kindheartedness and generosity that humbles me because
                it leaves me feeling as vulnerable as a sinner asking
                The Lord for forgiveness. I feel unworthy of it. I
                question if I even have such a right to ask for it. Yet,
                out of hope, I ask anyway. If you are wondering,
                the color blind gene is carried from the mother's side.
                My father is also Protan color blind. I want desperately
                to buy him glasses too. He told me to worry about my son
                first and not him. If (for some miracle) this campaign
                actually goes far enough to get money for two glasses,
                you bet I'm getting them for my Dad. I want him to see
                the true colors of a sunset after 70 years of not really
                knowing what it is he's been seeing all this time. I'm already asking for so much...but if you can

  infertile. A MIRICALE occurred and at 19 she has fallen pregnant, it
  is making her very sick and the doctors are pushing her to terminate.
  There is a medical team in Pennsylvania that has successfully
  delivered a healthly birth in the same situation. They are about to
  pack up to move to to see out the rest of her pregnacy with these

  mother. From this point on, I'll let her explain the full situation: ""Normally I am not one for these, but financial situations
    have changed. As some of you may know, back at the beginning of the
    year, my mother was informed she has cancer. She has the cells, but
    thankfully they haven't mutated over. Doctors have her on treatment,
    but they have cautioned her against over stressing, as that may
    cause the cells to mutate. Unfortunately, with my mothers other
    health issue, stress is par for the course. Years ago, she was in an
    accident, where she tore all the ligaments in her neck. She has to
    see a specialist every 2-3months, for botox injections to her neck,
    to temporarily restore use of those ligaments. Normally, this is
    covered under her health insurance. However, when she switched to a
    more local specialist, they handle the billing differently. My
    mother was paying out of her pocket, and not being reimbursed the
    full amount. This has since been fixed, but she was not compensated
    those initial payments. To put it into perspective, each vial of
    botox is $700, and she needs about six. (It's 12 injections to the
    neck). I only ask for help, because I can no longer afford to help
    her with the debt, due to my reduction of hours. And I don't want my
    mother over stressing, and risking the cancer becoming active.""",https://fundrazr.com/c1IiS8

  small group of health care workers whom are dedicated to improving
  lives of those less fortunate. In addition to assisting locally, we
  also travel to one of the poorest neighborhoods in Guatemala where we
  support The School of Hope  and Rekko Clinic. http://www.eftc.org.uk/our-work and http://www.rekko.org/index_en.html We are making our annual trip to Jocotenango, Guatemala in September
  2017.  We support a program that improves the lives of hundreds of
  improverished children. We cover our own travel and all associated
  expenses. We are asking you to help us raise funds for this school so
  that the children can obtain medical care at local clinics and
  hospitals. We continue to work with a local clinc and strengthen those
  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679
      students across the Foundation. On November 18, 2017 we are hosting a fundraiser at the Yakima Sports
  Center. We will be sharing our stories while hosting a silent auction,
  having a split the pot or 50/50 (winner took home almost $200 last
  year!) and games. Please help us with this fundraiser that will enable
  hundreds of impoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. In order to improve a population you need
  empowerment and independence. The proven form has been education.
  These children face countless socioeconomic and psychological
  barriers. A holistic approach is required to improve longterm
  outcomes. What these children face on a near daily basis makes all of
  our life obstacles seem pity. The staff and volunteers provide long
  term commitment. They genuinely care and love the community in which
  they are empowering. They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long
  term and sustainable commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless
  these socioeconomic issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any
  donation is greatly appreciated. These children are combating extreme
  poverty and many face inhuman conditions. This school provides a safe
  haven where they can break the cycle of poverty. All donations go
  directly to medical cost and does not cover any administration fees.

1468,Help the Tague's get through this trying time.,U.S. Dollar,580,22,0%,"My parents have had a rough month. In the past month, my parents
  traveled to Texas, twice, due to two unfortunate deaths of my Dad's
  neice, then two weeks later, his sister also passed away. Two weeks
  after returning to the Chicago area, my Dad nearly died after eating,
  yes eating! He had food stuck in his esophagus and tried to wash it
  down and ended up causing his esophagus to burst from the pressure
  (esophageal perforation of the thoracic region and left lung). This
  occurred the Friday after Thanksgiving. After being disagnosed with
  the large tear in his esophagusand adjacent lung, in the thoracic
  region (behind the heart), he was transferred to Rush Memorial
  University Medical Center where he would have died if the emergency
  surgery had not been conducted. He was sedated for two days while intubated. He is battling
  infection, high blood pressure and fluid in his lungs. He is
  conscious, but in no way out of the woods. Due to the nature of this
  injury, he will most likely remain in ICU for another week and in
  hospital for a couple weeks after that. This is where, on behalf of my
  parents, I am asking for support during this holiday season. While my
  parents both have jobs, they have exhausted all their vacation time
  and are currently both without income until the New Year. While there are benefits my Dad will most likely qaulify for, those
  applications and approvals take time. My mother is working with her
  employer to work from home, but she cannot do that until my Dad is
  released from the hospital. My parents are never ones to accept
  financial support, they are often the ones donating to causes and to
  others in need. I can attest that any donations accepted are beyond appreciated and
  will go directly to living expenses. The last thing I want my Dad to
  worry about, when he is fully aware of what is happening, is how his
  injury has caused him to be unable to work. The surgeons keep reminding my mom this is still a life threatening
  injury. I can't make him heal or expedite the recovery. What I can do
  is shed light on their situation and help alleviate one of the stressors. Any contribution is greatly appreciated and if you are unable to
  contribute, sharing this fundraiser is just as appreciated. Thank you so very much, Kristen Meghan",https://fundrazr.com/Dennistague
155,Give Andrew the Gift of Colour for his Birthday,U.S. Dollar,400,6,39%,"My son Andrew will be 27 this January, and has been colour
      blind for as long as I can remember. As a kid, he learned to adapt
      to his surroundings and distinguish certain colours based on what
      he knows to be constants ie: grass, blue sky. Andrew is an artist so he spends a good amount of time
      guessing actual colours but has integrated his knowledge of the
      Colour Wheel to help him draw and paint. As a person who can see
      in true colour, I am quite impressed at his interpretations and
      knowledge of actual colours. As his mom, it pains me to know that
      he cannot truly see the beauty of his own work or that of his
      colleagues. We have learned to adjust as his family. I tend to forget
      who I am talking to when I ask him to grab something out of the
      cupboard, or to find something for me. Instead of saying, ""I
      need the red bottle"", I have to describe the shape of the
      bottle or labels. Basic chores like cleaning up a spill can be
      irritating for Andrew because apple juice can blend in with the
      pattern of the counter top. Unless there is a distinct contrast,
      he can't see it. Andrew doesn't drive because he can't see the
      street lights or car lights. Gaining employment is difficult
      because he cannot see most Point of Sale computer screens,
      resulting in low self-esteem. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are
      not a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type
      and extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses
      are estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of
      red-green color vision deficiency. Andrew might never be able to drive but we believe that his
      employment opportunities will open up and his artistic world will
      expand, resulting in higher self-esteem and improvement in his
      quality of life. Since Andrew wears prescription lenses, we are
      asking for $400 to help pay for Enchroma Prescriptive Lenses
      through our local optometrist. Please help us give Andrew the gift of colour for his
      Birthday in January. Andrew has no vision coverage on his
      insurance, so we are doing this all out of pocket. Any amount

Everything happened so quickly and on the 23rd January he survived a very dangerous and difficult brain surgery. Although the surgeons were able to successfully remove the tumour we still received devastating news, Tom has Glioblastoma Multiforme which is an aggressive stage 4 cancer. Over the next 9 months Tom will undergo many rounds of both radio and chemotherapy, he has delayed commencing his dream course for a year in film and television so he can concentrate on getting well and kicking this horrible cancers butt. Tom’s attitude is amazing he has remained positive and even while waiting for brain surgery was considering getting into pastoral care once well to help others when they receive similar news. Oh and did I mention Tom is 19? There is also a chance that he may be selected to undergo an advanced clinical trial overseas with the hope of healing him completely this would be a miracle. Those touched by cancer know it doesn’t just take an emotional and physical toll but also a financial toll, his medical bills over the coming months are going to be extensive. My amazing friends and I have decided to rally together and raise as much as we can to help Tom and my dear parents. Tom is one of the kindest, gentlest souls in the world and would do anything for anyone, this is a chance for anyone who wants to help Tom or is just touched by this incredible story of how fast life can change by opening your hearts and generosity. We are planning a huge night of food and entertainment to raise funds for this incredible young man and need any help we can get. We would love any donations either financially or by donating goods or services for us to raffle or auction on the night. Please get in contact with us if you can help or know someone who can over the coming weeks. Watch this page as we will start to provide information on his fundraising evening. The support we have all received as a family has been phenomenal, please continue to hold dear Tom in your hearts.

    with choosing a matching outfit, which may deter potential mates
    from approaching. The poor guy always needs help when shopping, and
    often asks the non-colour blind population for an opinion on his
    outfit before he goes out into public. Finally, Justin cannot reach the full potential of his freedom
    without possessing the ability to get around. Although driving does
    not always pose an issue, Justin sometimes has difficulty with
    traffic lights. He once said, ""All I know is that if the bottom
    circle is lit up, you stop. If it's the top circle, you go.""
    The real problem occurs when he visits a new place where they think
    it's a good idea to have horizontal traffic lights. As you can see, there are many obstacles for Justin to overcome,
    but it is my hope that Enchroma glasses will start him down the
    right track to achieving his goals! Please support Justin in his
    journey of becoming a man and help him see the real world for the
    first time! Anything helps, even a like or share! Below you will see some first time experiences with Enchroma:",https://fundrazr.com/b1IHv4

1170,Please help Robert pay for his life-saving surgery,U.S. Dollar,15000,6,8%,"My name is Holly and I am doing this fundraiser for Robert's medical
  expenses. He has been one of the Three JellyBeans since 1971; we lost
  Bret Short, our other jellybean in October 2016. Robert has a long and difficult medical history, starting with
  his near-fatal wreck (as a passenger when an on-coming car nailed him
  and his friend) when we were in high-school. It was a long road back
  but he made it. He has the most giving heart of anyone I know, and truly would
  fit the cliche of giving someone the literal shirt off of his back. He
  is a very talented contractor/handyman and has worked for himself for
  many, many years. Like a lot of others these days, he has no health insurance. Robert had been having pains in his legs for a very long time
  that were mostly relieved by rest (rest being a thing Robert rarely
  gave himself). Fortunately, his neighbor flies for LifeFlight and
  recognized the pain, now unrelieved by rest, the ghost-white shade of
  his right leg and its icy coldness as being a serious problem and took
  him to the ER on Sunday (Jan. 7th). He has had many expensive
  diagnostic tests and imaging studies to isolate the problem and
  develop the treatment plan. The fantastic news is the heart cath showed only minor issues
  that can be treated with a statin. The dreadful news is his right
  iliac artery is 100% blocked and the left is 97%. The endarterectomy
  and possible stenting should be straightforward but for the fact that
  access is problematic due to the extreme amount of scar tissue from
  his long-ago car accident. As of this writing, he is on Day 4 of
  hospitalization and is in pre-op awaiting the surgery. With the
  blockage he has, not having the surgery would result in gangrene and
  ultimate loss of his limbs. Not acceptable!! The recovery, if all goes as planned, shouldn't be much worse
  than those having a femoral-access heart cath. A day of
  flat-on-the-back, then gradual resumption of the activities of daily living. Robert has a sister, who has a family with its own health issues
  and she herself has recently suffered a stroke. She is a retired
  schoolteacher and even the family resources are limited. I am helping Robert to navigate the options with the hospital's
  social worker and financial assistance departments, and to negotiate
  downward the final medical bills. Nonethless, they will be many and
  massive. The last thing Robert needs is stress about how he will pay
  for this. Being self-employed, no work means no pay. Having a highly
  physical job, light duty restrictions for a while greatly impacts his
  ability to earn a living. What he does have is a vast support group of friends, many for
  forty years or more. And while we all have our own financial issues,
  the power of crowdsourcing means even small amounts from friends,
  extended friends, and perhaps some compassionate and generous
  strangers will help him to meet his medical bills, and make sure the
  lights stay on. I will make sure food stays in his fridge, that he has
  the transportation to medical appointments he needs, and have offered
  him my guest room and ""nursing skills"" as he recovers. I ask you all to contribute however you can -- nothing is too
  small an amount. I of course obtained Robert's permission to raise
  these funds, and he agreed (although he's not a fan of the limelight,
  much less of sharing his needs: he has volunteered for years with the
  Red Cross, going in when families are burned out of their homes to
  provide lodging, food, and clothing, and he is far more comfortable
  being the helper, not the person in need). If you don't know Robert but you know me, please consider giving
  anyway. Since losing my beloved husband to metastatic colon cancer the
  week before Thanksgiving, I have been heartbroken and lost and in
  search of a purpose. THIS is now my purpose so any support you can
  give is as meaningful to me as it is to Robert. Sincere and heartfelt thanks in advance from me and from Robert,
  for reading to the end, and for giving whatever you can. N.B.: While not required by this site, Robert and I both feel a
  moral obligation to report how any funds raised are spent. We will not
  identify, for example, a specific doctor by name; however, we would
  share that ""$xxx was paid to the vascular surgeon at Piedmont
  Hospital for the surgery,"" or ""$xxx to the hospital for room
  and related charges,"" or ""$xx to the pharmacy for his
  medications."" There's just so much fraud and scammy stuff in the
  world, we hope this provides confidence to the donors. [I will provide an update after the surgery and as he
  progresses. This could be a very long road.]",https://fundrazr.com/61Jmqc

408,Enchroma Glasses for Pat,U.S. Dollar,375,23,109%,"Hello everyone! 1/11 Update: WE DID IT!! I just wanted to introduce myself. My
    name is Valerie, and I'm 18. I've had this idea since October when I
    first was able to see Movements live and talk to Pat. One of the
    first things he said to me was something along the lines of,
    ""Oh my god, sorry if this is weird, but your eyes are literally
    so big and blue."" Which, really isn't that weird considering
    I'm legally blind and wear 20mm prosthetic contact lenses, so I
    basically look like I'm straight out of an anime when I'm not
    squint-smiling. Anyways, that started a conversation between the two
    of us about my vision and the road I've had to take to restore it,
    and while we didn't talk much about his colorblindness, I went home
    that night and couldn't stop thinking about it. My entire life until
    recently, I had the opposite of what Pat sees. I couldn't really see
    detail or words or much of anything, but everything I saw was
    blotches of color. He sees what I couldn't, and I see what he can't. I remember the day I got my prosthetic
    contacts, which (along with a transplant), allow me to see nearly
    perfect 20/20 vision. I can't put that feeling into words, and it
    doesn't go away. Every morning when I wake up and put my prosthetics
    in, I get that same feeling. And I thought to myself, what if I
    could give him even something remotely similar to that feeling with
    just a pair of glasses? So here we are. I know that money is
    tight for pretty much everyone right now, but even a dollar or two
    can get us there. I'm personally going to be covering about a fifth
    of the cost, but that's really all I can do on a college student
    budget. If all goes according to plan, I'm going to be giving him
    the glasses on 3/14 at the Nashville show. I will definitely keep y'all posted on
    everything, and if you have any questions, you can DM me on Twitter
    at @FOURSlMPLEWORDS (the i in ""simple"" is an undercase L) - Valerie PS: The glasses are only $349, but there
    is a service fee I have to pay for the fundraiser, so that is why
    the goal is $375. I'm too lazy to do the actual math to figure out
    the exact amount we need with the fees factored in, but as soon as I
    have $349 with fees being paid, I'd end the fundraiser ____________________________________ WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

214,Please donate towards Addisyn's Medical costs READ,Australian Dollar,5000,3,4%,"Addisyn Rose Simpson This is a long story, but please take the time to read all of
    it. Thank you! My tiny little princess Addi was born on the 08.12.2017 weighing 4
  pound 5 ounces, absolutely tiny for a full term baby but my little
  Addi unfortunately had other issues. Addisyn was my fourth child, I have Kade - 6 , Kobi - 3 & Ivy -
  15 months! After having 3 perfectly healthy beautiful babies prior I
  didn't expect to be told at my 20 week scan that I would have to go
  back for a specialist scan because they had found abnormalities in my
  daughters heart. Unfortunately worst then first thought Addisyn would be born to
  suffer from the worst congenital heart defect -Tetralogy of Fallot
  (TOF). Having TOF means that instead of one CHD Addisyn suffers from
  3+. Addi has 2 VSD's (holes in her heart) one being quite large that
  requires surgery before she is 6 months old, her outflow tract that
  connects her heart to her lungs is far too narrow, she has a thickened
  right ventricle & one of her main arteries is in the wrong
  position so it is not pumping blood the right way. The worst part
  about it all is the chd's she has all affects blood flow to her lungs,
  Addisyn is on a heart monitor consantly, she struggles with breathing
  quite often, she gets tired very quickly, her weight is stunted (she
  is nearly 2 months old and the same size as a normal newborn baby) ,
  she sometimes turns blue from lack of oxygen & even if she gets
  too wound up or loses her breath when she cries she will turn blue
  & start having seizures! TOF is fatal if left untreated, 50% of
  TOF sufferers who don't seek treatment die before the age of six!!
  That is why it is super important we get Addi all the help we can get
  for her! Unfortunately no one in Tasmania specialises in TOF so we have to
  travel to Melbourne to be seen for all of her appointments regarding
  her heart and even more unfortunately there is no funding allocated to
  help us with these travelling cost. Addi's first specialist
  appointment is booked for next month and we have had to pay $200 in
  flights return, $170 on a hotel in Melbourne CBD and we have had to
  put $200 aside for anything else I may have to pay for (taxi's, food
  etc) That is $570 just for one appointment and these are appointments
  Addi has to attend monthly until surgery. Addisyn has to have at least 3 open heart surgeries to correct her
  TOF. That makes for at least 3 times we have to fly to Melbourne and
  pay for accommodation for 3 weeks over there while she recovers! The
  Hospital will pay for Addisyn and myself's flights and subsided
  accommodation but if we want my husband & our 3 other children to
  be able to come and support there sister / daughter we will have to
  fund there flights and accommodation! I have spent no more then a full
  48 hours without seeing my children, if we are unable to afford to
  have them come to Melbourne with us I would be absolutely devastated
  and so distraught and with them only being 6, 3 & 14 months old
  they are far too young to be without there mother for 3 week periods!
  So PLEASE dig deep & if you are able to please donate to us to
  help fund Addisyn's Medical & travelling expenses we would be
  forever grateful!! We would love to be all kept together as a family!

Our goal is to raise at least enough to cover the out of pocket expenses for the hospital.He is on a Medical Leave of Absence from his beloved job from mid- Feb. 2012 until he returns in August 2012 for the next school year.  His doctors said his prognosis is excellent, and he and Anne look forward to August when he returns to teaching and coaching. Until then, they will incur out-of-pocket medical expenses and deductibles, plus normal living expenses.  The transplant is mostly covered, but as with most insurance, there are many unknowns. He will be unable to work for nearly five months and Anne, as his primary caregiver, will be unable to work as a substitute teacher. You may donate via PayPal OR directly to Phil Parker Medical Fund, Wells Fargo Bank c/o Angela Mashburn, Vice President 37 Magnolia StreetRoswell GA 30075 Thank you all in advance!

8075,Please help us fund Michelle's Heart Transplant,Canadian Dollar,30 000,55,27%,"Do you know Michelle, like I know Michelle? I first met Michelle
  almost 8 years ago when we were taking a course together. We became
  fast friends as we shared a love of family, food and life. Her
  positive and caring spirit along with her amazing sense of humor have
  always inspired me. She has made a career as an incredibly talented
  Stylist and has shared her passion with a great many colleagues and
  students over the past 23 years. Just over a year ago, upon returning home from a business trip to
  California, Michelle started experiencing minor symptoms of not
  feeling well and knew that something was off. There is no way any of
  us could have predicted what would follow. It turned out that Michelle
  was in Congestive Heart Failure and was taken by Air Ambulance out of
  Williams Lake so that further diagnostic tests could be performed. Her
  husband Jamie was working out in the middle of the Chilcoltin and it
  was uncertain if we would be able to contact him. By the efforts of an
  amazing friend, he was reached and given the shocking news that his
  wife was in Cardiac Failure. The results of these early test had her
  referred to much more specialized Doctors in Vancouver at St. Paul's
  Hospital. She was admitted to hospital to undergo more specialized and
  invasive tests and underwent surgery to implant a Cardiac
  Defibrillator. Immediately prior to discharge Michelle was informed
  that she would need to have a Heart Transplant and that she would need
  to be on a regimen of extensive medications and dietary restrictions
  to stabilize her heart while we waited for transplant. This was
  shocking news to say the least. Michelle had been tested from an early
  age on a regular basis because a heart condition ran in her family.
  Her older brother died of a sudden cardiac event at age 15 in 1982 and
  her Father in January of 1990. No cardiac symptoms presented in
  Michelle and by age 32 she figured that she didn't have the genetic
  defect, and like so many others, found herself without a Family
  Physician so did not undergo further cardiac testing for over a decade. Michelle has not been able to work since May of 2016 and has had to
  travel to Vancouver from Williams Lake several times over the last
  year to see the team of Transplant Doctors. With becoming a single
  income household, she is anxious as to how to pay for the upcoming
  expenses that will be incurred for Transplant, a burden she does not
  want to leave to her Husband, Jamie, to figure out. Recently Michelle and Jamie were evacuated from their home due to the
  wildfires surrounding their hometown here in BC. They spent 3 weeks
  away from home and it was while they were evacuated that Michelle got
  the news that she is now ""active"" on the Transplant list.
  This means that BC Transplant is actively looking for a Donor Heart
  match for her and that they could get the call at anytime. Michelle will have to remain in Vancouver post-surgery in order to be
  monitored for symptoms of rejection and infection. She will not be
  able to be on her own in the weeks and months immediately following
  surgery and it is anticipated that she will have to remain in
  Vancouver for up to 12 months to participate in the rehabilitation process. I have always known Michelle to be kind and thoughtful and usually is
  happiest helping others or feeding people. She has a joyful and
  generous spirit and is beloved by many but especially friends and
  family. Will you help Michelle and Jamie and alleviate the pressure of
  this monumental journey they are about to go through? Even the
  smallest donation will help. Please donate today and help this very
  special person not have to worry and be focused on her recovery.",https://fundrazr.com/newheartformichelle

        stood in front of all the coloured boxes and stared at them
        confused. That's when alarm bells started ringing and we took
        him to the optometrist. Surely enough he was diagnosed with

        about all the beautiful things he cannot see. We were so happy
        and hopeful to here about these glasses which will help him to

  with cancer two weeks ago, and this cancer is treatable, however, it
  has now spread to other organs, and there is a more aggressive one to
  deal with, amongst others. The medical bills are adding up, and the medical aid will not pay, so
  this is where we come in, lets make it very simple... She is our friend, and she needs our help!!! PLEASE NOTE ANYONE WISHING TO DONATE FROM NAMIBIA OR SOUTH AFRICA,
  PLEASE SPEAK DIRECTLY TO SALOME'S BROTHER, JOHAN KOTZE. IF YOU'RE FROM
  ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD, PLEASE USE THIS PAGE, THANK YOU XXX Here is a message from Salome: Buckle Up! I'm sure that's what Dr Eagles whispered as I
    walked all shocked and in disbelief from his office. He had just
    told me that at the ripe old age of 38 I have both Rectal and Colon
    Cancer. An aggressive tumor that can drastically change my future, 4
    cm into my rectum, and a slightly less aggressive tumor in my Colon
    15cm in. I had no idea how fast everything would happen after that. By then I already knew that my Medical Aid had rejected my
    Sigmoidoscopy procedure that led to the discovery of my tumors. They
    said no as they see it as a""pre-existing"" medical
    condition. ""Cancer does not develop overnight Mrs Pope"".
    This is a complete pain in the ass (No pun intended) but I have to
    add in their defense that I had only joined their aid two months
    prior. I was immediately referred to Dr Zietsman, the best oncologist
    in Namibia, who had arranged within days for me to start my Glow in
    the Dark Radiation Therapy together with Chemo (in tablet form).
    This takes place every day for 5 to 6 weeks with a break over the
    weekends to let me body rest. We will then have an Operation to see
    how much of the Bad Boy Rectum tumor we can remove. Then continue
    with another 4 months of stronger chemo which has been upgraded to 6
    months of a much stronger chemo due to further secondary cancer
    spreads in my right lung and also my liver which were detected only
    last week. The support from my family and friends is unbelievable. My
    mother and father have been wonderfully positive and reassuring me
    without worry that everything will be ok financially. It is really
    difficult for me as my parents, now retired and pensioners, are
    willing to spend all their hard earned savings and pension money on
    my medical bills. Their loving daughter who they adore so much will
    bleed them dry financially. But then my brother and very dear friends decided that they
    will start campaigning for donations. I have been overwhelmed by
    this gesture and I am extremely grateful for what has been done and
    the donations received so far. For those people who donated
    anonymously and who I haven't been able to personally thank - Thank
    you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you Russel and Mark, my
    brother Johan, my mum Minnie and my Dad Johan, Bernidine and all
    other of my friends involved that I'm not even aware off. You guys
    are fantastic! You are making my sleepless nights worry less and

    be able to respond immediately but please bear with me and I will
    reply. Blessings to everyone and only good thoughts to all. I'm

    psychiatrist's office.  My doctor will prescribe a PTSD service dog
    for me and I have found a breed, Newfiedoodle puppy, with the right
    characteristics.  Cost of this dog & airfare to pick it up is
    $2000. It will take approximately 1 1/2
    yrs. to complete this training so the dog is certified nationally as
    a PTSD service dog and will accompany  me everywhere I go.  I am
    committed to training and loving a dog who can enable me to lead a

  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color accuracy. Most people have three types of color-sensing cones in their
      eyes: red, green, and blue. The wavelengths of light that these
      three cones absorb have overlapping regions. Color-blindness is
      often a result of a malfunctioning cone that causes wavelengths to
      overlap even more, resulting in poor color discrimination. The
      EnChroma glasses use a filter to cut out these overlapping
      wavelengths, allowing for a clearer distinction between colors,

  The Conde family is extremely grateful for each and every one of you.
    The saying "" It takes a village"" is definitely true in
  this situation. How does a family properly thank someone for the
  things that they have done to help out during difficult times?  You
  need to know how much all the prior well wishes, positive thoughts,
  prayers, donations, helping with meals, helping out with Lucas, gifts
  for Jake, time spent together, and friendship has meant to the Conde
  family - THANK YOU! Here we go again... Where do I even begin?  Honestly, it's really
  difficult to gather thoughts, considering so much has gone on the past
  77 weeks.  As most of you know, Jake was diagnosed with Ewing's
  Sarcoma in his left femur bone in April of 2015, when he was 9 years
  old. To keep it short, it was a very long year with many nights in the
  hospital, multiple biopsies, surgeries, chemo, lab/diagnostic testing,
  physical therapy etc.  It was a nightmare, but they got through it -
  or so they thought.  Shortly after his year long cancer treatment
  ended, Jake started having pain in his shoulder and losing weight, so
  they took him in for testing.  Then came the devastating news, which
  was even worse than the first time around.  Not only was his cancer
  back, they were told that Jake had 6 metastatic tumors. Cancer sucks!
  Sarcoma sucks! Many of you have emailed or left messages for Steph, Roger, and
  myself asking what you can do to help. First and foremost, for those
  of you who pray, please keep Jake in your daily prayers.  Jake has a
  birthday coming up, he turns 11 on October 22nd.  If you would like to
  send him a card or write him a note, you can mail it directly to his
  home, or contact me (my number is below) for more information. For
  those of you who would like to make a small donation, that would be
  great too. I know that they are spending thousands of dollars out of
  pocket each month. Currently Jake has had five in-patient chemo treatments (each 5 days
  long), and goes back in on Monday 10/17 for his sixth treatment.  A
  recent scan showed only 2 of his 6 tumors as active - this is good
  news!  The current plan is to give Jake 18 months of chemo - that's
  the bad news!  The chemo is taking a toll on him, the drugs are very
  hard on your body, it's been tough! In addition to chemo, the Conde family strongly believes in an
  alternative and holistic approach this time around; they believe
  that the chemo alone will not cure their son.  Jake is eating all
  organic and non-gmo foods, using essential oils, cannabis oil,
  juicing, drinking alkaline water & special teas, taking
  supplements... You name it, they're doing it! What the Conde family is going through is impossible to comprehend. 
  We've watched Jake go from being such a happy, funny, spirited
  child who was so full of life, to fighting for his life. What are the
  days during chemo and just after chemo like for them now?  At times
  Jake is screaming/crying in pain, has anxiety/fear of upcoming
  procedures/testing, vomits throughout the day, spends most of the day
  on the couch or in bed with no energy, is up sick most of the night,
  feels depressed, angry, and lonely at times. It stinks! It's really
  tough to see him/them go through this!  Roger and Steph are up around
  the clock caring for Jake, it's 24/7!  But, they continue to stay
  strong, believe in miracles, and have hope!  Losing is not an option! During Jake's first year of treatment Jake watched a lot of Adam
  Sandler movies in the hospital, Stephanie and Roger expressed how
  those movies helped them get through the awful hospital stays. 
  Laughter soothes the soul!  If you have any really good funny movie
  suggestions that are appropriate for an 11 year old, please make suggestions. The best therapy for Jake and family right now is for them to get out
  of the house (when Jake is feeling well), or to have company; they
  love to be around friends and family every chance they get. Even if
  it's for a short time.  Don't be afraid to reach out! We are all thankful for every minute, hour or glimpse of happiness
  that Jake feels. When he smiles, we all smile! Thank you for your concern and continued support.

275,I've never seen the color of the rainbow,U.S. Dollar,349,10,79%,"I went through 14 years of my life
      without even knowing I was colorblind. But then one day in my 9th
      grade Biology course, my teacher made each of us take an online
      colorblind test (similar to the one on enchroma.com). I failed it
      with a 20%. Apparently he thought I was lying, because it counted
      for a quiz grade. One day I was eating with my
      friends in the University of West Georgia dining hall, and I
        decided to have some delicious mashed potatoes and gravy.
        However, due to my colorblindness, I did not realize that the
        ""gravy"" next to the mashed potatoes was actually BBQ
        sauce. Worst mashed potatoes and gravy ever. Colorblindness isn't really a disability to me, I already find the world God made
      beautiful. The crazy thing is, everything I have every seen is
      more colorful than I can even imagine. Apparently rainbows have
      more than two colors, but I already think they are amazing. I've
      always wondered what the Spring time looks like to a normal
      person, and I'd really like to experience that with these EnChroma

3075,Help for Howard,U.S. Dollar,113 000,27,27%,"Written diligently on my phone over many hours as we are presently
  without a working computer in our home... Hey All- While it seemed that nothing but fake news was all that one could
  find wherever one looked, my world just got very real with some
  information regarding my health. Briefly, here is the gist of it all... Recently I've been struggling with issues of balance and hearing and
  was referred to a neurologist and subsequently to have an MRI of my head. These scans revealed a growth on my right side, and I was diagnosed
  with a vestibular schwannoma. So, what is that anyway? I know, it sounds like a sandwich, but in fact is a slow growing
  tumor originating off of my auditory nerve. Sometimes called an auditory neuroma, these growths are considered
  pretty rare overall. The good news is that it is self-contained and benign. The growth is not actually in my brain, but rather beginning to press
  on various nerves which are associated with my ability to walk,
  balance and function particularly affecting my right side. Apparently this thing has been growing for  20-30 years and first
  began to reach a size to where its presence affected the
  aforementioned nerves a few short months ago and has me to the point
  of my  not getting around that well. Given the size of the tumor and the ways it is impacting my life, the
  best option is a surgery to remove the growth. Eventually, if not removed or somehow reduced in size, the tumor will
  continue its slow but steady growth and my functionality will decrease
  and at some point my brain will run out of room to accommodate this
  impeding guest. This could be another 20-30 years but I am already experiencing
  significant loss of my abilities and quality of life. I am a total proponent of our own innate abilities to reduce and/or
  reverse growths and such in our bodies and surgery has been something
  that I've shied away from even until recently. Hell, I've spent most of the last 20+ years working tirelessly to
  hold this perspective for clients who have lost sight of these very truths. That said, I still come from the same place but am humbly, after much
  inner dialogue, choosing to go ahead with the surgery. Honestly I reached this decision after realizing that I lacked a
  certain strength and really needed help. The surgery is scheduled for the morning of the 12th and will take
  about 5 hours. This is unfamiliar ground for me, as it surely is for most. I am pretty scared and well out of my comfort zone! Following the surgery, my stay in the hospital should only be 3-5
  days with a possible indeterminate time at an in-patient rehab
  facility thereafter. The length of time at the rehab will depend on how well and quickly I
  can recalibrate and recover my abilities to balance and walk, etc... As far as recovery and returning to work, I'm being told a month
  depending on how I respond. The other day I had the occasion to speak with a local woman who
  underwent basically the same procedure a few years ago and she related
  it taking almost 3 months before she was feeling ready to get back to
  her job. Everyone is different and each case unique, I get that.  What I mean
  to say is that there are many unknowns... Hence my creating this campaign to ask for your financial assistance. I have not worked in at least a month, and it's been 2 or more since
  I've done anything full time. Fortunately I do have insurance, albeit limited coverage, through my
  wife's employer, but the bills are already beginning to wrack up. With doctor visits, running here and there, plus 2 MRIs the costs are
  already well beyond our means with the surgery, hospital stay and
  potential rehab yet to come. I'm not going to endlessly post asking for your assistance. If you can or want to donate towards this, cool. And if you can't or don't want to, also cool. Share or don't share as you see fit, both are good. I'm not going to make any promises here  that could come around to
  weigh upon me should I be unable to fulfill them. Please don't be put off by the goal, as this  amount was only set to
  not limit our cause here. Of course anything offered is a great gesture of kindness and totally appreciated! Lastly, I really hope to impart that what is most relevant and
  welcomed is your words and love during this time. Yes the money piece is important, and something that really takes a
  lot of my energy as I worry about that side of things  but what I
  truly seek right now is connection with those I love. If you are reading this then in some way you fall into that category. I'm not very communicative especially on social media, and definitely
  even less so as of late. I wasn't in the right awareness until now to fully disclose all that
  I've been dealing with. Part of my way of addressing things is to reach further into my own
  depths for understanding. Sometimes this can be interpreted as polarizing or dismissive but I
  assure you this has not been my intention. I'm simply trying to be okay, like we all are. I guess I'm a stoically private guy when it comes to my personal
  life, but for those who do have interest I wanted to share some of
  what's been going down with me. Peace and Thank You, Howard",https://fundrazr.com/01EjG6

  chronic medical problems. We are waging a campaign for Seth concerning his ailing health.
  With proper medical care, Seth's health issues could be under control

  places him at grave risk. The combination of repetitive parole denials
  and neglectful medical care equates to a extrajudicial death sentence
  for Seth. In addition struggling to receive medical care, Seth is also
  fighting for his rights at the parole board. Seth is a model prisoner
  and meets all criteria for release, yet has been repetitively denied
  parole for no other reason than ""the serious nature of the

7021,Ancestral Microbiome: Chasing Health,U.S. Dollar,of 25000,19,5%,"Since the summer of 2013, my colleagues and I have been working and
  living among the Hadza hunter foragers of Tanzania. As the last hunter
  forager group in Tanzania - who literally still hunt the same animals
  and gather the same plants that our ancestors did for millions of
  years - the Hadza may hold in their guts some
    important clues to what a healthy or optimal gut microbiome might
    look like at different stages of life. By collecting stool samples from hundreds of Hadza as they shift
  between seasonal resources - and freezing them in liquid nitrogen in
  the field - we use next generation sequencing to map composition of
  microbes in the Hadza gut. With this information - along with detailed
  diet and lifestyle data - we can compare this ancestral microbiome to
  thousands of westerners in the American Gut Project - the
  largest open source and crowd funded science project in the world (a
  project I co-founded). Even though we've raised money for the Hadza project - and received
  mountains of free sequencing via our colleagues at the Earth Microbiome Project - we need more funds to
  continue our field work. What we've accomplished and learned so far and what else needs
    to be done: Accomplished and Learned Collected and sequenced ~1,500 fecal, skin, water, soil, animal
    and plant samples from ""Hadza Land"" over the course of two
    field sessions (2013-2015). This represents the largest number of
    samples ever sequenced for a rural or ancestral population anywhere
    in the world. Acquired and outfitted a 4x4 Land Cruiser for rough and rugged
    landscape of East Africa (and cobbled together tents, tables,
    chairs, satellite dish for internet, and so on for our base camp). Trained two Tanzanian field assistants - ongoing process. Put together a world-class team of researchers - who are mentioned
    in this 3-page feature about our project that appeared in the
    prestigious journal Science - from New
    York University, Stanford, UCSD, and researchers from the National
    Institute of Medical Research in Tanzania to collaborate on the analysis. Applied for and acquired all necassary permits and ethical
    clearances (IRB) for the study in Tanzania and the U.S. Not any easy
    task given the layers and layers of bureaucracy! Though we haven't published any of our data yet (coming 2016), we
    are excited that we have documented a seasonal shift in the Hadza
    gut microbiome between dry and wet season. This is critical as it
    goes to the heart of what an optimal or balanced gut microbiome
    might look - in other words, it may be a moving target if evolution
    is our guide. We also see differences between men and women,
    something we don't see in western societies. We also see much
    greater diversity of microbes on and in the Hadza when compared to
    us westerners. Mounting research suggests this diversity may be our
    ancestral state and protective! We also don't see a drop in the
    diversity as Hadza age - something that happens in western
    populations. We also see an extraordinary diversity of microbes in
    the Hadza environment as a result of our environmental sampling of
    plants, animals, soil, water and so on. This ""meta
    community"" of microbes is the source pool for Hadza microbes.
    We also see interesting patterns in the breastfed babies not seen in
    the western babies. And the list goes on! What Needs To Be Done - WE NEED YOUR HELP Based on our initial sampling and data, we will be submitting our
    results for peer-review publication in 2016. This is where
      you come in! We need funds for diesel, fuel, beans and rice,
      supplies, salaries for Tanzanian research assistants, and
      never-ending repairs to our aging field vehicle. Every nickel counts! Now that we have sampled a large number of Hadza across multiple
    seasons and bush camps, we are now focusing on following a much
    smaller group of Hadza for detailed longitidunal sampling (we are
    also very, very interested in detailed sampling of newborns,
    essentially sampling them from birth through introduction of first
    solids at 4-6 months). In addition, we want to expand our data set
    of environmental samples from plants and animals in Hadza land as
    this is critical to understanding where and how a
    ""free-living"" human population acquires microbes from the environment. If you would like to consider an ""off line"" donation

  I was diagnosed with End Stage Renal Disease when I was 20. Back then,
  I was a graduating college student. Before we found out that I have
  Kidney Failure, I went to school every day ignoring headaches,
  palpitation, water retention and the other symptoms. At first, we thought that I had anemia because I looked pale. We even
  suspected that it is due to the lack of sleep and stress from our
  thesis. Then the symptoms became worst, so my Mom brought me to the
  doctor and we found out that my hemoglobin is low. The doctor then
  advised me to inject epoetin alpha thrice a week to regain my
  hemoglobin. We did a few tests to determine why my hemoglobin is
  rapidly dropping down. Then the truth was revealed, based on the
  laboratories my creatinine level is too high and isn’t normal. Without hesitation my family rushed me in to a Kidney Specialist at
  National Kidney Transplant Institute (NKTI) to clarify things and for
  a few more checkups and laboratories. The result of my laboratory
  tests and Kidney Ultrasound shows that I have End Stage Renal Disease
  Secondary to Chronic Glumerulonephritis (CGN). The doctor told my
  family that I have two options to live: Kidney Transplant or Dialysis
  (can be peritoneal or hemodialysis). Hearing those words shattered me into pieces. It felt like I lost my
  dreams and my future. We also visited other hospitals for second
  opinion but unfortunately they all advised the same. All hopes were
  crashed down and I broke down into tears, then. Back then, I knew how hurt my mom was because my father died with the
  same illness when I was 3 years old, and my brother was 2. My
  relatives didn’t want me to undergo dialysis because it is a
  continuous process that needed a lot of money. My father also
  undergone hemodialysis but my family failed to continuously sustain
  it. My mother raised us alone. She worked as a dressmaker. She also
  did part-time jobs, such as selling meriendas, being an Avon reseller,
  and more, to suffice our needs and to send me to hospital. Now, I am still undergoing hemodialysis at San Pascual Hemodialysis
  Center at Paombong, Bulacan. Somehow, I also managed to graduate and
  finish my studies. I badly wanted to live a normal life again.  That’s
  why I am doing my best and using whatever talent that was given to me

7035,MONSTER INSIDE- Spine Fusion Metal Implant Allergy,U.S. Dollar,120 000,14,6%,"URGENT: My name is Lana Sinclair, I thank you for taking time to read
  this. My son Richard had a spinal fusion and found out he is allergic
  to the metal hardware holding his spine together. He is suffering
  tremendously from a metal MONSTER INSIDE his spine that triggered auto
  immune disease and unbearable pain. I humbly ask for your support and
  need donations for expenses to get urgent specialized medical
  treatment and surgery to remove the toxic metal. His story is lengthy, but I feet it is very important to share
  information and raise awareness in medical community and public
  about metal implant allergy, a MONSTER INSIDE. RICHARD'S STORY: In September 2011 Richard was injured in a car accident. The auto
  insurance company was not cooperative and refused to authorize payment
  for treatment.  His only option was county health plan and he had to
  see the doctor they assigned. It did not cover any treatment he
  needed. His condition rapidly deteriorated. After being in pain and
  asking for months he finally had an MRI. The results showed spine
  abnormalities and he was referred to an orthopedic surgeon for a
  lumbar spine microdiskectomy in March 2013. The county health
  insurance would not cover physical therapy. I lost my job for needing
  to take time off to assist my son, and had to move immediately. I had
  bought Richard a classic car for his 16th birthday, he had it for 12
  years. Richard loved that car but sold it to help pay to move to a
  place that would allow our beloved pets ... to this day I am sick at
  heart he had to. In September of 2013, 6 months after surgery, the insurance finally
  approved physical therapy. The very first day of pool therapy, the
  disc previously operated on herniated. I was at work, Richard barely
  made it home and called me and said something was wrong, he couldn't
  walk. I rushed home and called an ambulance. The ER staff said they
  didn't know what was wrong, the MRI looked ok and kept him overnight
  for observation. I went home to check the pets and get some sleep. My
  son called me the next morning, said they discharged him saying it was
  a pulled muscle. He told me he kept begging them to listen, he was in
  agony and they made him get up when he could barely walk. He was in a wheelchair waiting outside the hospital when I arrived to
   pick him up. I didn't know what to do or think. I barely got him in
  the van to to go home. It took 1/2 hour to go from the van into the
  house and help him lay on the bed. He could not get up and was
  screaming in pain. I called ambulance again and demanded they take him
  to a different hospital. We told the ER doctor what happened, he
  checked the medical system and came back and told us the other
  hospital read the wrong MRI, the lumbar disc was badly herniated. They
  did not have the facilities to do anything, he had no choice but to
  send my son back to the first hospital by ambulance to have surgery. The previous surgeon was called in to see Richard and told him he had
  to have lumbar spinal fusion, with metal rods and screws to stabilize
  the lower spine. He operated the next day and Richard was discharged
  in 23 hours because insurance wouldn't pay for longer stay. Almost
  immediately Richard complained of a different kind of pain and there
  was a strange discharge from the incision. After returning home the following day,
  Richard's entire lower back was swollen and severely
  bruised. I freaked out when I saw how bad it was and called the
  surgeon's office.  I described the swelling, bruising and heavy
  discharge, I had to change dressing frequently. I wanted to take him
  to the doctor but Richard wasn't supposed to ride in a car that soon
  after surgery.  The nurse said it was nothing to worry about. I was
  persistent and took my son to the surgeon's office and demanded they
  do something, his back was horrific looking. The surgeon had a shocked
  look on his face when he saw how bad it was and extracted several
  viles of ""fluid"" from his back. They gave him antibiotics
  and sent him home. The incision finally healed but Richard did not
  feel good and he complained about a ""different"" kind of
  pain. The doctor said it was going to take time before it got better!
  He was told to follow up with family doctor after that, due to
  insurance they would not be able to see him. We got notice to vacate because our rental was sold. We had to move 2
  weeks after Richard's 2nd surgery October 2013. By the grace of God we
  found a landlord with a soft heart willing to work with us and allow
  pets and our neighbors helped us move. The last 4 years since the spinal fusion have been a living hell for
  Richard. After the 2nd surgery Richard began experiencing bizarre
  immune reactions and digestive problems. Not only has he suffered
  physically, but the relentless pain has taken a toll on him. He went
  from being healthy, active and happy to being held captive of the
  pain, going to from the bed, the chair, the couch, constantly changing
  positions, unable to sleep well or relieve the constant gnawing
  burning stabbing pain. Richard always loved being around a lot of
  people, and he has been isolated by his illness. His cat Bud is his
  constant companion and best friend. My son went to the ER for unexplained swelling and acute pain flare
  ups. My son's concerns and symptoms were ignored and he was referred
  to pain counseling...because they did not see anything they assumed it
  was ""all in his head"". Richard waited months for
  appointments, I have taken him to every major medical facility in
  Michigan in search of help and relief. Nothing offered helped.  One
  painful and frustrating dead end after another, paying out of pocket
  for expenses, travel and treatment. My son continues to suffer because
  (1) specialist/doctor will not accept insurance, (2) denied coverage
  for doctor ordered treatment or (3) did not cover much if any (4)
  would not listen/test/investigate symptoms. Despite exhausting every possible option we could think of nothing
  helped,  Richard's symptoms got worse and worse.  My son was told he
  had failed fusion syndrome and some people have a lot of pain
  afterward and he would have to learn how to cope with it.  One doctor
  said they were going to ""rip out the old hardware and put new
  fusion hardware in the rest of his spine"". Others said everything
  looked good go to pain counseling, it's all in your head. It was
  dehumanizing, frustrating and terrifying because every opinion my son
  got was something totally different. Who was right? Were they all wrong? My dear daughter had done her best to help her brother Richard
  throughout the ordeal. She too became ill during this time and had to
  have surgery. She had genetic testing for tendency for certain
  illnesses, she shared an article about it. I wanted to help and
  understand what she was dealing with and began to read medical
  research articles, and one day by chance, I tripped across an article
  on metal allergy. MONSTER INSIDE: The article was about a ""MELISA test"". A
  very comprehensive blood test that can detect if a person has metal
  sensitivity to a wide spectrum of surgical and dental implant metals.
  I then searched and found case studies written by doctors on patients
  who had a wide variety of bizarre auto-immune response symptoms
  including uncontrollable pain caused by metal implant devices. It was
  as if I was reading a story about my son. I also learned that metal
  surgical devices used have the potential for allergic reaction and
  patients should be tested PRIOR to surgery. Not one of the medical
  facilities I had taken my son to had ever investigated a possible
  allergy to the metal implant hardware. The side effects from prolonged
  exposure to metal toxicity are VERY VERY serious. Richard went to a special clinic to be tested, the results came
  back.. he tested POSITIVE for Titanium allergy. Most surgical metals
  and alloy components break down and corrode over time when exposed to
  body fluid and tissue, emitting particles into the body and triggering
  immune response. I was appalled to learn that Richard had not been
  tested prior to surgery, even though I later learned the implant
  manufacturer WARNED that patients should be tested and the device
  should be removed as soon as the bone had fused (healed). My son had
  it in his body for almost 4 years!!! The thought of what would have
  happened if that one doctor had fused the rest of his spine with the
  same metal makes me nauseous. It was surreal to find out what had been causing the horrific pain
  and symptoms but it quickly changed to ""Oh my God, what can be
  done now? Who can help my son?"" When it comes to the Spine, there
  is absolutely no room for a mistake if my son was going to have a
  chance. I contacted previous medical providers with no success. I
  began calling all over the state and country looking for surgeons. I
  could not find anyone with expertise that would work with the
  insurance situation and take on a complicated case. It has been a long
  dragged out nightmare. Many of the doctors had never heard of metal
  allergy,  some did not believe us, some would not take complicated
  cases, or would not accept the insurance anyway. I am scared if the
  wrong surgeon operated it could do irreversible damage and permanently
  cripple my son. I have 3 notebooks of all the doctors and hospitals across the
  country I have called and pleaded for help. We have been to every
  major medical facility in Michigan, went to Cleveland Ohio, went to
  Houston Texas, went to San Diego and Los Angeles California and have
  consulted by phone with surgeons in New York, Oregon, Utah, Idaho,
  Chicago and have had no success getting a highly skilled surgeon that
  is willing to help. My son is running out of time. The hardware is loose because it never
  healed and is compressing his spine. His conditions worsens each
  passing day, the only option for surgery is to go overseas. We
  consulted with a leading expert surgeon and he has confirmed he can
  remove the toxic hardware, access and repair damage to vertebrae and
  surrounding tissue from prolonged exposure to toxic metal and insert 3
  custom made spine non toxic stabilization devices. It will take a team
  of doctors to operate, treat auto immune and other metal toxicity
  related issues after surgery and rehabilitation. Our goal is to raise
  $120,000 by February 1, 2018 to be able to book surgery before the end
  of the month. My son's health and future is at stake. I gratefully and humbly
  appreciate donations to help with lodging, transportation, meals and medical. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Please Share. *METAL ALLERGY INFO: The symptoms are often overlooked. I know there
  are other people out there that are sick and in pain, suffering
  auto-immune disease and they don't know it could be caused by a metal
  implant, dental work or other surgical device. Go to MELISA.org for
  testing info. I hope sharing this story will spread awareness in the
  medical community and public. Please share with your loved ones, ask
  for a metal sensitivity / allergy test before any dental or surgical implant.",https://fundrazr.com/b1HI85

      two of those family members know that they mean something to us
      and that we think of them, even when they're not around as much. I found Enchroma a couple of
      years ago. I don't know how I did, if it was an add, or through a
      friend or acquaintance.. I truly can't remember, but somehow I
      did. I had both of my brothers take the test online and they both
      were evaluated as moderate deutans. No surprise there, they were
      both diagnosed as children.. Funny story there, apparently my
      parents didn't know both of their boys were color blind, but one
      had shown signs. When the test was being administered to my oldest
      brother Chris, my other brother Jon was looking over his shoulder.
      They asked what number Chris saw - he replied that he didn't see
      any number. Jon thought they were messing with him, because he
      piped up ""What numbers!?"" I have been wanting to get them Enchroma glasses for a
        while now, but 1. They're expensive and I don't personally make
        a ton of money. 2. I was nervous about how they would react.
        Would they be excited? What if they got upset? Why wouldn't they
        be excited!? It's one thing to read about what these glasses can
        do, but to experience it? ...There's no way to compare it,
        right? So I have to take the plunge! I want  to do this for
        them, because what are sisters for? They are for love and
        support and sharing . I want to share with them
        the colors they have never been able to experience. But I need help. I would love to be able to get them each
        a pair of these glasses, because while I live in the Austin TX
        area, one brother lives in Houston, and the other in South
        Dakota! Ugh! Distance! If I can get enough money raised to pay for one of the two
        pairs +, I think I would be able to take the hit and pay for the
        rest of the second pair myself. Otherwise they'll have to share! Any help is appreciated. Sometimes people don't realize
        how far just a couple dollars can go, and in this case, it's to
        help people see a world of color. (P.S. I'm totally making them
          watch Wizard of
        Oz with these things!) WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/ChrisandJon
330,Help Zara to continue therapy and to start walking,Euro,20 000,8,2%,"Hi! I'm Zara. Zara Sivčević. I'm 11 and half years old. I don't walk … I
  have cerebral palsy - hypotonic syndrom. I was born in 28th week of my
  mom's pregnancy.Prematurely born – prematura nata … Unfinished,undeveloped,with a lot of deformities. Unhealthy … Based on Appgar's scale for newborns, I was ZERO ( 0 ) . I wasn't
  given any chances to survive. The doctors told my mum and dad I wasn't
  going to survive. They told them, even though I survive, I was going
  to be a plant . They were saying I was going to vegetate... I was breathing, I was loved .. Love used to guide me day by day . I
  had my right hip twisted and I underwent surgery. My feet were in
  equinovarus and they underwent surgeries for three times. I had dioprty –11 on both of my eyes and a difficult shape of
  strabismus . I also underwent surgery for my left eye .. I'm from Bosnia and Herzegovina. My mom and I moved to Slovenia back
  in 2008., when I was two years old. Now I'm 4th grade of primary
  school in Center for education,rehabilitation and orientation. Now I
  ride an orthopedic bicycle,and I also swim and ride .. I used to drag my body on my elbows. Now I can sit down and lift up
  my body on my knees. By using orthoses and walker, I can even stand up. Starting January 08th 2018 year, I got an appointment for therapies
  of Neurorehabilitation robotics in Zagreb. Eight weeks of intensive
  six-houred everyday therapies. All those therapies could help me on
  getting a steadily standing, balance and walking. Therapies cost 12.558,00 € . My parents don't have that money,
  because they have been paying my treatments and rehabilitation in
  Slovenia for nine years : five surgeries,buying of orthopedic
  apparatures, therapies and our living in Ljubljana. I'm sincerely asking you to help me to get this money, so I can start
  with my therapies !! I think it won't harm your finances . I suggest that you pay in only
  1 €, and then you ask your friends to do the same. Wouldn't it be
  fantastic if if twelve thousand five hundred and fifty eight people
  pay in only 1 € each for Zara Sivčević ? For me !! And then,starting
  by January 08th, I could begin with my therapies. May that be your New Year's or Christmas wish for somebody you don't
  know, but what you do know is that that person has an enormous wish to
  walk. To step up in the life on her own ..For me..For Zara !! I can assure you that you'll start going towards the stars together
  with me. Because only those who have an sincere desire in their
  hearts, a wish to spread love and well being around them. Only they
  know the path towards the stars !! Give me your hand and let's start
  together !!!! https://www.facebook.com/zarakazvjezdama/ FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNT TO PAY IN FOR ZARA SIVČEVIĆ Gordana Bojanovic Sivcevic ABANKA VIPA d.d.

  hodam. Imam cerebralnu paralizu-hipotoni sindrom. Rođena sam u
  28. nedjelji trudnoće moje mame. Prijevremeno rođena-prematura nata.
  Nezavršena, nerazvijena, sa mnogo deformiteta. Nezrela. Po
  vrijednosti na Appgarovoj ljestvici novorođenčadi bila sam nula
  (0). Nisu mi davali nikakvu šansu da ću preživjeti. Mojima, mami
  i tati su govorili da neću preživjeti... Govorili su im da i ako
  preživim da ću biti biljka... Govorili su da ću
  vegetirati... Disala sam. I bila voljena. Ljubav me je vodila dan
  po dan. Imala sam iščašen desni kuk. Operisana sam. Imala sam stopala
  u equinovarusu. Tri puta su mi ih operisali. Imala sam uz dioptriju
  -11 na oba oka i težak oblik strabizma. Operisano mi je lijevo
  oko... Iz Bosne i Hercegovine sam. Sa mamom sam se preselila u
  Sloveniju 2008. godine, kada sam imala dvije godine. Sada idem u
  četvrti razred osnovne škole u Centru za obrazovanje, rehabilitaciju i
  usmjerenje. Sada vozim biciklo-ortopedsko, plivam, jašem. Nekada
  sam svoje tjelo vukla na laktovima. Sada sjedim, dignem se na koljena
  i uz pomoć ortoza i hodalice stojim. Od 08. Januara 2018. godine
  sam dobila termin za terapije Neurorehabilitacijske robotike u
  Zagrebu. Osam tjedana, intenzivnih svakodnevnih terapija po šest
  sati. Sve te terapije bi mi mogle pomoći na pridobivanju čvrstog
  samostalnog stojanja, ravnoteže i koračanja. Terapije koštaju 12.
  558, 00€. Moji roditelji nemaju taj novac, jer devet godina plaćaju
  moje liječenje u Sloveniji: svih pet operacija, kupovinu ortopedskih
  pomagala, terapije, naše življenje u Ljubljani. Molim vas da mi
  pomognete da skupimo novac i da započnem sa ovim
  terapijama. Mislim da vam to nije veliko izdvajanje iz vaših
  finansija. Predlažem da uplatite samo jedan eur (1€). Onda zamolite
  svoje prijatelje da i oni učine isto. Zar ne bi bilo neobično
  fantastično da dvanaest hiljada i petsto pedeset osam ljudi na ovoj
  planeti uplati samo po jedan eur (1€) za Zaru Sivčević. Za mene.
  I tada bih ja početkom januara 2018. godine mogla započeti sa
  terapijama. Neka to bude vaša novogodišnja ili božićna želja
  nekome koga ne znate, ali znate da taj neko ima iskreno veliku želju
  da hoda. Da sam zakorači u život. Meni. Zari. I budite sigurni da
  ćete samnom krenuti ka zvijezdama. Jer samo oni koji imaju iskrenu
  želju u srcu, želju da oko sebe šire ljubav i dobrotu, samo oni znaju
  put ka zvijezdama. Pružite mi ruku i krenimo zajedno. https://www.facebook.com/zarakazvjezdama/ DEVIZNI RAČUNI ZA UPLATU ZA ZARU SIVČEVIĆ: Gordana Bojanovic
